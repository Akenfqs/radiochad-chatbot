20
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
Hi Laurent-Alexandre.

21
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Uh...

22
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:40,720
So I just sent you a request so you can be a speaker.

23
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
There you go, it works, perfect.

24
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,720
And then Coral just arrived.

25
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
Hi Coral.

26
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
So here we go.

27
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
Uh...

28
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
Well, welcome Laurent.

29
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
How are you?

30
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,720
So I know this is your first time on Twitter Space.

31
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,720
So I don't know if you're on your phone or on the computer, but normally you have a button...

32
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,720
If you're on your phone, you have a button at the bottom left to unmute yourself so you can speak.

33
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
Ah, there you go.

34
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
It's good.

35
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Ah, great.

36
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Well, welcome.

37
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
How are you?

38
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Very well.

39
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,720
Well, I'm honored to have you here tonight.

40
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
Uh...

41
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,720
To be honest, I wasn't really expecting you to accept, but...

42
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
Ah.

43
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
There you go, you accepted.

44
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
You're among us.

45
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,720
So, welcome.

46
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
And then...

47
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
So that's it.

48
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
So today, I wanted to...

49
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,720
So, every Tuesday we do a show on artificial intelligence.

50
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
Uh...

51
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
We often have debates...

52
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Well, actually, we discuss...

53
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Most of the time it's theoretical.

54
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,720
That is, we talk about both tools that have just come out, because they come out of tools...

55
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,720
As you know, all the time, all the time, it's a real effervescence right now.

56
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
It doesn't stop.

57
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
It's...

58
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
Anyway, it's exponential.

59
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
So...

60
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,720
Every time, every week, it's more and more crazy things that come out.

61
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,720
And in fact, it takes us a lot of time in the show.

62
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,720
And also, we do a little bit of reflection on the subject.

63
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:11,720
We try to debate the future of AI, and especially the future of humanity, of our civilizations.

64
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,720
What's going to happen to us?

65
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
What's happening to us, actually?

66
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,720
More and more, we're talking less and less about the future, actually.

67
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Because it's...

68
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
It's...

69
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,720
It's there.

70
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,720
And it's really funny, because...

71
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Before, AI wasn't...

72
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,720
It wasn't a subject, not that long ago.

73
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,720
And at the end of 2022, it exploded, and now we're only talking about that.

74
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,720
And that would be my first question for you, actually.

75
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,720
So you wrote a book that just came out, called...

76
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
So...

77
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,720
I forgot!

78
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,720
The War of Intelligences, by Chadept.

79
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,720
And it surprised me that you mention Chadept in the title,

80
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,720
because it could seem like a tool, among others.

81
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,720
Is it precisely the fact that it triggered a wave,

82
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
the wave that we know today?

83
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Or is it something else?

84
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,720
What's the reason why there's Chadept in the title?

85
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,720
So, the first AI-generative tool that is widely public is, of course, Chadept.

86
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,720
But Chadept was the trigger for the wave.

87
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Everyone knows that until November 30, 2022,

88
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,720
until the release of GPT 3.5,

89
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,720
no one really believed in the potential of AI-generative tools.

90
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,720
We have testimonies from many people.

91
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
We have the Lequin testimonies,

92
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,720
which explain that LLM-type neural networks,

93
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,720
like Chadept, will never have a model of the world.

94
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,720
We have Bill Gates, who explained three months before the release of GPT 3.5

95
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,720
that LLM is not scalable and has not much interest,

96
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,720
even though he's a guy who's a little aware of what's going on at OpenAI,

97
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,720
since he's still the first shareholder of Microsoft,

98
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,720
which controls 49% of OpenAI's capital.

99
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,720
And despite Bill Gates' presence at the heart of the device,

100
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,720
he was completely wrong until three months before the release of GPT 3.5.

101
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
So yes, there was a shock.

102
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:26,720
There was a shock with the release of a product that was perceived as revolutionary by people,

103
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,720
which had a much greater impact than Sam Altman, the founder of Chadept, expected.

104
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,720
Sam Altman didn't think there would be millions of users.

105
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,720
He thought that the IA generatives of Chadept would develop slowly.

106
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,720
So yes, the release of Chadept on November 30, a year ago,

107
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,720
was a shock and launched a wave of use.

108
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,720
And then, at the moment, a wave of values.

109
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,720
There is certainly a bubble at the moment, a bubble of valorization.

110
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,720
Justified or not, the future will tell us.

111
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
But in any case, we are in a bubble.

112
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,720
So yes, for me, the release of Chadept in version 3.5,

113
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,720
almost a year ago, was a shock.

114
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,720
And it justifies that it is considered an important step.

115
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,720
So, since we are on Chadept,

116
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,720
did you see that there is a new version that has just been announced?

117
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,720
Chadept 4 Turbo.

118
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,720
I don't know if you saw the conference yesterday.

119
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,720
Yes, of course.

120
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,720
I was surprised that the attention window went up so high,

121
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,720
to 128,000 tokens, that is, more than the current version of Cloud.

122
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:49,720
I thought that Cloud would keep the leadership in terms of size of the attention window.

123
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,720
But OpenAI is working very well and has a lot of money,

124
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,720
with the 11 billion that were given by Microsoft.

125
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,720
OpenAI has more users and more money than Cloud in Tropik,

126
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,720
despite the money that was put in by Google

127
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,720
and the 4 billion that were promised by Amazon.

128
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,720
I thought Cloud was going to be that, its specificity.

129
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,720
But in fact, OpenAI is going to be the Google of the AI.

130
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,720
We don't know.

131
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,720
Netscape had 99% of the global market of Internet browsers

132
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,720
and Netscape died in a thousand days when Microsoft launched Microsoft Explorer.

133
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,720
So it's quite difficult today to say what will happen.

134
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,720
The advance of Chadept is important, of OpenAI is important,

135
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,720
but we must not forget that Gemini from Google is coming out

136
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,720
and that Asabis has brought together an absolutely exceptional team

137
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,720
by merging Google Brain, the teams from Bard,

138
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,720
and then its own DeepMind teams in London and elsewhere.

139
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,720
So the battle is not over at all.

140
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,720
So to come back to the book,

141
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,720
and before we talk a little more about things,

142
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,720
maybe metaphysical, I don't know if we can say that.

143
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,720
In the title, there is also the war of intelligences.

144
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,720
What is the book about? What is the war you are talking about?

145
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,720
The book describes what is happening.

146
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,720
We are entering a world where intelligence is going to become free

147
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,720
and where almost infinite quantities of intelligence are being produced.

148
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
I share Altman's vision,

149
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,720
which is that the amount of intelligence on Earth will double every 18 months,

150
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,720
a kind of conditioning wall of knowledge,

151
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,720
and that mechanically, as human intelligence does not increase,

152
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,720
the essence of intelligence produced on Earth will be artificial intelligence.

153
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,720
The marginalization of human intelligence, of biological intelligence, is underway.

154
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,720
That doesn't mean that we will necessarily be squashed,

155
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,720
it doesn't mean that Terminator is on the street.

156
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
But there is one thing that is certain,

157
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,720
it is that almost all of the intelligence produced on Earth in the future

158
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
will be artificial intelligence.

159
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
This challenges us a lot,

160
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,720
because we did not expect the neural networks to progress so fast.

161
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,720
We did not expect the neural networks to understand human language.

162
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,720
By the way, Harari, who sometimes says nonsense,

163
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,720
but sometimes very intelligent things,

164
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:34,720
has described very well how much the LLM can hack civilization

165
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
by their very good understanding,

166
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,720
even if they do not have artificial consciousness,

167
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,720
of language and therefore of the human psyche.

168
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,720
My book speaks of the consequences of this new situation,

169
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,720
of the total desynchronization between institutions, politics, civil society,

170
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,720
workers, and then the tsunami of artificial intelligence.

171
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,720
To take only one example,

172
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:15,720
the school has not benefited from computer progress at all since 1980.

173
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,720
The computer power expressed in flops,

174
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,720
in floating-point operations, of French national education,

175
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,720
has been multiplied by one million billion.

176
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,720
I heard your argument at Pinkerview,

177
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,720
and you say that students have not benefited from such a…

178
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
No, they have not moved at all.

179
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
So it measures, anecdotally,

180
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,720
but it measures the desynchronization between the school and artificial intelligence.

181
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,720
And then, as we live in a taboo,

182
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,720
which is that the school has an important impact on intelligence,

183
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,720
we have trouble defining a strategy

184
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,720
to allow future children to be competitive against AI,

185
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,720
because we do not dare to admit the truth,

186
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,720
which is that the school does not know how to reduce intellectual inequalities,

187
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
and if it knew how to do it, it would see it.

188
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,720
We can only see every day that the school has a very low impact

189
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,720
on the reduction of cognitive inequalities, of intellectual inequalities.

190
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
And then the ultimate taboo is that,

191
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,720
what everyone knows, among neurogenetic specialists,

192
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,720
is that intelligence is mostly genetic,

193
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,720
and that the school cannot fight against genetic determinism

194
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,720
with the very frustrating tools it has today,

195
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,720
which poses a real problem.

196
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,720
A very important part of the population will be marginalized.

197
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:49,720
So the solutions behind it are a little worrying.

198
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,720
Between post-human hybridization with the implant of Mosque,

199
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,720
or the solution of Sam Altman,

200
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:05,720
which is the generalization to a very large part of the population of universal income,

201
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,720
we have solutions that are, from my point of view,

202
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
rather unacceptable,

203
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,720
in any case, I don't like them very much.

204
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,720
The idea that has been developing since the end of the pretense to Altman,

205
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,720
that the majority of the population will not follow the future versions of each GPT

206
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
and its competitors,

207
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
and that people will have to be at universal income,

208
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,720
and I find something absolutely atrocious.

209
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,720
The idea that less gifted children

210
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,720
will go to universal income after school,

211
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
until they return to the school,

212
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
is really dramatic.

213
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,720
And I think that we don't realize

214
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,720
the speed at which artificial intelligence is progressing.

215
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
I was very struck this summer.

216
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,720
I did a little test that has no scientific value,

217
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,720
and I didn't publish it in a scientific journal,

218
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,720
but I took a nurse with GPT-4 versus me,

219
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,720
without GPT-4,

220
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,720
to analyze complex medical files.

221
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,720
Well, a nurse with GPT-4 is crushing me in medicine,

222
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,720
and yet I'm not lazy.

223
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,720
I'm training a lot,

224
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
I'm still following medical news,

225
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
I've worked a lot in my life,

226
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,720
but I'm crushed, not overwhelmed,

227
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,720
but crushed by a nurse with GPT-4.

228
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,720
We're entering a new world that we hadn't foreseen.

229
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,720
And as I've said several times,

230
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,720
on November 29, 2022,

231
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,720
the day before the release of GPT-3.5,

232
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,720
what GPT-4 does in medicine today,

233
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,720
I didn't think it would be possible before 2040, 2050.

234
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,720
I didn't think a neural network

235
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,720
could analyze a medical file with errors,

236
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
with abbreviations,

237
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,720
with unstructured data in the international classification of diseases,

238
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,720
and be able to diagnose and treat,

239
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
even if there are still hallucinations,

240
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,720
and that from time to time GPT-4 is wrong.

241
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,720
Its power is very impressive,

242
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,720
and far beyond what I imagined.

243
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,720
So yes, there is something...

244
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,720
We'll come back to the story of universal income,

245
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
because we had a debate on this

246
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,720
about two weeks ago,

247
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
and it was quite interesting.

248
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,720
We were debating libertarianism,

249
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,720
and I consider myself libertarian,

250
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,720
and I'm open to this question,

251
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,720
and others are libertarians,

252
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,720
more hardcore than me, were against it.

253
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,720
So it was interesting to have this discussion.

254
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,720
But just before that,

255
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,720
I would like to come back to this school thing,

256
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,720
because I think we agree on the fact that

257
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,720
today, if you want to educate yourself,

258
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,720
it's still better to do it with artificial intelligence,

259
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,720
to have a history teacher who is an artificial intelligence

260
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,720
rather than a history teacher who will literally read

261
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,720
what's in a manual.

262
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,720
But the thing is, there is a paradox in this.

263
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,720
If you learn through artificial intelligence,

264
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,720
in fact, artificial intelligence doesn't teach you to think.

265
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,720
And it's those who have learned to think

266
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,720
who will eventually become part of artificial intelligence.

267
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Artificial intelligence can learn to think,

268
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,720
but the problem is not there.

269
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
The problem is taboo.

270
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,720
Most people don't educate themselves,

271
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,720
don't read, and don't work on their intellect.

272
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,720
So the school is there for children

273
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,720
who don't necessarily want to learn things,

274
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,720
to learn a minimum.

275
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,720
But most people don't learn anything.

276
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,720
The number of books read by French people

277
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,720
is zero, except in intellectual elites.

278
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,720
So the school is there to force people to learn this basis,

279
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,720
which they would not spontaneously learn,

280
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,720
because the percentage of intellectuals in the population is very low.

281
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,720
I am, like everyone else, concerned,

282
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
and this is not something new,

283
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,720
when I see the statistics of the number of books read by French people,

284
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,720
it is almost zero.

285
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,720
Most people don't read,

286
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,720
whether in paper or electronic format.

287
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,720
So we shouldn't ask too much of the school,

288
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,720
but what we can ask of the school

289
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,720
is that it forces the majority of the population

290
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
to learn a minimum basis

291
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,720
that allows them to be literate,

292
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,720
even if this minimum basis is not known and mastered by everyone.

293
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
As you know,

294
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,720
I quote from the war of intelligence during the GPT,

295
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,720
30% of young French people,

296
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
35% of young Italians

297
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,720
leave school without being able to read

298
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,720
and summarize a simple text of five lines.

299
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,720
So the basic literacy

300
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,720
is not mastered by a Frenchman out of three

301
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,720
and by a young Italian out of three,

302
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,720
and it's about the same in most countries.

303
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,720
So yes, the elites can be formed with GPT 5, GPT 6, GPT 7,

304
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,720
who will probably become good teachers

305
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,720
and will be able to determine adapted programs,

306
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,720
personalized programs.

307
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,720
But the problem is not the formation of the elites.

308
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,720
I have no concern about the fact

309
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,720
that the intellectual elites will live a golden age.

310
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,720
We will be the golden age of innovators,

311
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
and of start-uppers and intellectuals.

312
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,720
Of course, what worries me

313
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,720
are the non-intellectual classes,

314
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,720
people who have more cognitive difficulties

315
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,720
and who will be drowned in the ultra-complex economy

316
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
that we are creating,

317
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,720
and with a totally unloyal competition

318
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,720
from the artificial intelligence.

319
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,720
Because I hoped that the robotic shock

320
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,720
would not be in sync with the shock of AI.

321
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,720
But the first robots with artificial intelligence

322
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,720
are starting to happen.

323
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,720
There is the range of Neo robots developed by OpenAI

324
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,720
in partnership with a robotics company.

325
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,720
There are Tesla's robots,

326
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,720
Tesla's Optimus robots,

327
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,720
which will also be equipped with artificial intelligence,

328
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,720
even if we do not yet know

329
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,720
if it is the Grok artificial intelligence

330
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,720
from Twitter that will be injected into Tesla's robots

331
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
or another artificial intelligence

332
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,720
that has not yet been revealed by Bill Gates.

333
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,720
This means that we cannot exclude

334
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,720
that in 2030, the 35-hour diamond washer

335
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:53,720
will be competed by 24-hour diamond washing robots

336
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,720
with the intelligence of a polytechnician

337
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
who went through Harvard.

338
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,720
And there we would be in great difficulty

339
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,720
for manual workers.

340
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,720
Because it is clear that today

341
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,720
manual workers are not, except for very rare exceptions,

342
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,720
capable of a cognitive skills of an engineer,

343
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,720
of a philosopher, etc.

344
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,720
However, to put GPT-5 in a robot in the future,

345
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,720
it will cost zero.

346
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,720
So robotics will not be a stupid robotics

347
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,720
as we imagined it before.

348
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,720
Robotics will be an ultra-intelligent robotics.

349
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,720
And so it poses a real competition problem

350
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,720
for the non-intellectual classes

351
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,720
that we have not thought about at all.

352
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,720
Because people imagined that in the future

353
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,720
artificial intelligence could compete with the middle classes.

354
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,720
But there are two things that we had not seen.

355
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,720
It is that the upper classes would be competed by AI.

356
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,720
Because AI does better than lawyers or doctors

357
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,720
more and more things, to take only this example.

358
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
And it will be the same for engineers

359
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,720
in two years, three years, five years.

360
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
And then the second point that we had not seen at all,

361
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,720
it is the fact that manual workers

362
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,720
would be competed by intelligent robots

363
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,720
at a date that is difficult to determine.

364
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,720
Because we have not yet seen the robots of Elon Musk work.

365
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,720
We have not yet seen the range of robots of each GPT.

366
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,720
So we do not know at what speed

367
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,720
this robotics can develop and generalize.

368
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,720
But in the hypothesis, or it would be the case,

369
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,720
we would have a real social problem.

370
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,720
Because I think that the intellectual elites

371
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,720
will become complementary to artificial intelligence

372
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
in the coming years.

373
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
They will work a lot for it.

374
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,720
I'm not sure that the carpenters

375
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,720
have the ability to fight against the robot carpenter

376
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,720
having the cognitive abilities of a normal human being.

377
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,720
I'm not sure I agree with the class analysis.

378
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,720
But one thing is certain,

379
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,720
we are heading towards a society where there are those who will...

380
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,720
What is the problem with class analysis?

381
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
What do you mean?

382
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,720
That is to say that those who will be privileged

383
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,720
will be the super creative.

384
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,720
It's not really a question of social status or anything.

385
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,720
That is to say that those who will have mastered the tool,

386
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,720
it can come from anywhere.

387
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,720
I remind you that on average,

388
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,720
creative people are smarter than on average.

389
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,720
Creativity is a form of intelligence

390
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,720
that is rather possessed by the smartest people

391
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
than by the dumbest people.

392
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,720
So to say that innovators are smarter than the average

393
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
is a factual reality,

394
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
even if it is politically incorrect.

395
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,720
I'm not quite sure about the correlation between class and intelligence,

396
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,720
even if I see what you mean.

397
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,720
The great innovators have always been very smart.

398
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,720
All of them.

399
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,720
Steve Jobs was very smart.

400
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,720
The very creative artists were mostly very smart.

401
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,720
In reality, there is a fairly good correlation

402
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,720
between the capacities of innovation and general intelligence.

403
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,720
Wouldn't it be the opposite?

404
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Wouldn't it be that the classes that are formed eventually

405
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,720
are the consequence of intelligence

406
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,720
that is implemented in specific areas,

407
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,720
rather than the opposite?

408
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,720
I understand this politically incorrect view,

409
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,720
but that's not how it works.

410
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,720
Intelligence is not linked to the cultural environment.

411
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
It is only linked marginally.

412
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,720
All studies show it.

413
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,720
Unfortunately, and I deeply regret it,

414
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
intelligence is mostly genetic.

415
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,720
The correlation is not in the sense you hope it is.

416
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,720
It would be better if it were in the sense you hope it is,

417
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,720
because we could reduce intellectual inequalities.

418
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,720
But alas, if we can't reduce intellectual inequalities,

419
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,720
it's because intelligence is,

420
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
to my great regret,

421
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,720
mostly of genetic origin.

422
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:15,720
The example of the carotid surgeon is quite good.

423
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,720
Many people will end up on the carotid.

424
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:25,720
So we either try to make everyone as intelligent as possible

425
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,720
to be able to master or compete with artificial intelligence,

426
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,720
even if there are many things to say about it.

427
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,720
And at that moment, we enter a highly competitive society,

428
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,720
much more competitive than what we know today.

429
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,720
Or there is a part of the population

430
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:50,720
that must be paid a universal salary.

431
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,720
Or, not the universal salary, but the universal income.

432
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:04,720
Or we practice a child-by-couple policy, or even less.

433
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,720
Or maybe other options.

434
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,720
Child-by-couple, we are already there.

435
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,720
In South Korea, it's even worse,

436
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,720
it's 0.79 children per couple today.

437
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,720
So, the problem with the universal income,

438
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,720
and the reason why I am totally opposed to it,

439
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,720
is that if there is an important part of the population

440
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,720
that does not work, generation after generation,

441
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,720
and that leaves the power to an elite

442
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,720
that organizes everything with the help of artificial intelligence,

443
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
we synergize with artificial intelligence,

444
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,720
we will create a world like Metropolis.

445
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,720
We will create a deeply unequal world.

446
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,720
The step, very quickly, after 50 years,

447
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,720
will be to remove the right to vote from people who do not work.

448
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,720
When after three generations, with the universal income,

449
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,720
we still refuse to work, we will lose the right to vote.

450
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,720
Mechanically.

451
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,720
Our grandchildren, our great-grandchildren will say,

452
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,720
but why would we leave the right to vote

453
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,720
to people who have not worked for 150 years?

454
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,720
And so we will have an unequal society with serious political problems.

455
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,720
And for people who would put universal income,

456
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,720
it's dramatic, because of course there are intellectuals

457
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,720
who will spend their days in museums

458
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,720
and reading Proust or Dostoyevsky.

459
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,720
But most of the population,

460
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,720
their only intellectual effort is related to work.

461
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,720
I said it earlier, most people do not cultivate themselves,

462
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,720
read zero books and do not make intellectual efforts.

463
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,720
The only place where you need an intellectual effort is at work.

464
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,720
If they are no longer at work,

465
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,720
we will have a lot of depressed people who will crack,

466
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,720
who will be quite unhappy and who will be strongly marginalized.

467
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,720
So from a moral point of view,

468
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,720
from a philosophical point of view and from a political point of view,

469
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,720
the universal income, from my point of view,

470
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,720
builds a nightmarish society.

471
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,720
I think that it is not to serve people,

472
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,720
but to let them do nothing.

473
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,720
When artificial intelligence gallops,

474
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,720
it is better to collectively think about how to make everyone

475
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,720
complementary to artificial intelligence,

476
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,720
even if it will not be an easy fight.

477
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,720
Because again, it is not politically correct,

478
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,720
but the smarter we are, the faster we form.

479
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,720
The less clever we are, the slower we form.

480
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,720
So it will be very difficult for the less intelligent people

481
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,720
to gallop behind artificial intelligence,

482
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,720
because there is an extraordinarily strong correlation

483
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,720
between intelligence and the ability to learn,

484
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,720
between intelligence and the ability to form.

485
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,720
We can see very well when we discuss with HRDs

486
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,720
that there are people who cannot remember anything,

487
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,720
even in long training sessions of several months.

488
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,720
On the contrary, we know that there are people who learn

489
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,720
200 pages of quantum physics in one morning.

490
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,720
Our ability to learn is very, very, very, very, very unequal.

491
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,720
And so we will have a real difficulty,

492
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,720
it is that there are people who will not succeed in training

493
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,720
to find a complementarity zone with artificial intelligence.

494
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,720
I have written several books on AI already,

495
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,720
and I have regretted for years that there has never been a reflection

496
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,720
on the adaptation of the school to AI,

497
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,720
and on how to help people who have less cognitive facilities

498
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,720
to stay in the race or to find ecological niches,

499
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,720
cognitive ecological niches to exist and to continue to work.

500
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,720
And I repeat, I have no concern about the fact

501
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,720
that the intellectual elites will train,

502
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,720
will learn new things and will work

503
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,720
to find complementarity zones with artificial intelligence.

504
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,720
My point is not to focus on the intellectual elites,

505
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,720
about whom I have no concern.

506
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,720
No concern about the fact that they will live to see an age of gold.

507
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,720
But I am more worried about people who have a lot of trouble learning,

508
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,720
who do not read well, who read slowly,

509
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,720
and who, from my point of view, will have great difficulties.

510
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,720
Inequalities of memory are very important.

511
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,720
There is about a gap of 1 in 1000 in the French population

512
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,720
between those who remember the best and those who remember the least well.

513
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,720
A gap of 1 in 1000. It's huge.

514
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,720
When you need to train quickly,

515
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,720
because behind GPT-4 Turbo there is GPT-5,

516
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,720
then GPT-5 Turbo, then GPT-6, then Clot 3, then Clot 4,

517
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,720
you need to have memory to train,

518
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,720
even if memory is not enough to train.

519
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,720
Inequalities of 1 in 1000 in the ability to remember,

520
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,720
in the speed at which you remember a page,

521
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,720
is something absolutely dramatic in a world of technological tsunamis.

522
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,720
I'm not sure about the history of memory,

523
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,720
but I suggest we come back to that a little later.

524
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,720
You are not sure of what? What are the gaps?

525
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,720
For example, it's not really scientific,

526
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,720
it's just personal experience.

527
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,720
I have a very bad memory, really. It's catastrophic.

528
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,720
But I have a very good logical reasoning.

529
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,720
I can associate things if they make sense to me,

530
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:33,720
so I can associate ideas, create concepts.

531
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,720
I still have a good capacity.

532
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,720
It's called memory.

533
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,720
I don't learn anything by heart, I learn like you.

534
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,720
I have the same memory as you.

535
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,720
That's memory, that's real memory.

536
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,720
Real memory is not learning recitations by heart, word for word.

537
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,720
It's making a link between concepts to give them meaning

538
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,720
by building a tree of knowledge.

539
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,720
You're wrong about what memory is.

540
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:07,720
You have a vision of memory, of CO2.

541
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,720
But that's learning.

542
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,720
Not much.

543
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,720
You can improve your memory a little bit.

544
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,720
You can't increase your intelligence,

545
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,720
but you can increase your memory by training, by working,

546
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,720
but not a lot.

547
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,720
You can do all the efforts you can,

548
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,720
but you will never have the photographic memory of people

549
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,720
who have photographic memory.

550
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,720
But we don't need photographic memory to resist GPT-4.

551
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,720
But there are people who can remember a whole page in a second.

552
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:51,720
And you will never, ever, ever acquire that by working.

553
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:56,720
So yes, we can improve our memory, but not that much, unfortunately.

554
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,720
We'll come back to that a little later,

555
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:13,720
but before that, I'd like to talk about a subject that is connected to crypto.

556
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:19,720
I don't know if you've noticed, but it's a radio show that takes place every night,

557
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,720
and 70% of the time we talk about crypto.

558
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:29,720
Crypto is a fairly new technology that appeared 15 years ago with Bitcoin.

559
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:38,720
I saw you mention the word blockchain during your interview with Sky on Thinkerview.

560
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,720
I wanted to know what you think of crypto, to start with.

561
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,720
So in the crypto, blockchain, NFT world,

562
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,720
I bought an NFT that I still have on my cell phone,

563
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,720
with a totally invitable security key.

564
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,720
I have a hard time understanding this universe.

565
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,720
That's why I wrote in Express a paper,

566
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,720
I don't understand blockchain.

567
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,720
You're going to be replaced by an artificial intelligence, be careful.

568
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,720
It's not totally true, but I have a hard time.

569
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,720
So what do I think of it? I think it's immature.

570
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,720
I think there are still a lot of people who have been fucked,

571
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,720
who have been robbed of their money without realizing it,

572
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:30,720
that there is no security of exchange platforms,

573
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,720
of cryptos, that the number of scandals per week is still significant,

574
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,720
and that you have to spend a lot of time not to get fucked.

575
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,720
And I know very smart people who have been fucked,

576
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,720
especially thanks to our friend Sam.

577
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,720
So I don't think this universe is suitable for everyone.

578
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,720
You have to spend too much time to understand it.

579
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:57,720
Personally, I prefer to spend time to understand the evolution of LLM,

580
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,720
rather than to try to understand this opaque universe,

581
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,720
which is the universe of cryptos.

582
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,720
Which is fascinating, I recognize it,

583
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,720
and I understand that there are people who are interested in it,

584
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,720
but I have better things to do.

585
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,720
And in any case, I'm not going to invest my money in this sector,

586
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,720
because the time it would take me to not get fucked,

587
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:23,720
is too important compared to the little free intellectual time I have,

588
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,720
and that I prefer to devote to other projects that I consider to be priority.

589
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:37,720
If you want, frankly, I think that crypto is an incredibly elitist technology,

590
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,720
because it's really complicated to understand how it works.

591
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,720
And above all, I repeat it for the third time,

592
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,720
it's really complicated not to get fucked.

593
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:54,720
If you want, the probability that your savings account book will disappear and you will have zero,

594
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,720
the probability that you will get your money stolen when it is in the crypto universe,

595
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,720
it is still very important.

596
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,720
Yes, that's true.

597
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,720
And so it's a little worrying,

598
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,720
when it comes to money, to be able to get fucked so easily.

599
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:13,720
If you want, the 1850s banking world, with bank bankruptcy on a repeat,

600
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,720
was unstable and you risked losing your money quite often.

601
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,720
But then the crypto universe is much worse.

602
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,720
Yes, you're not completely wrong.

603
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,720
It's a completely legit reproach.

604
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,720
No one of your listeners, in my opinion,

605
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,720
can think that it is a universe where we are sure to get our money back.

606
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:45,720
Because everyone thought that the little crypto genius was going to keep our money.

607
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,720
And in reality, we saw how his platform,

608
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,720
following these absolutely catastrophic mistakes and misrepresentations,

609
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,720
ended up in the trash of technological history.

610
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,720
Yes, because that's a total paradox of the ecosystem.

611
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,720
In fact, normally the crypto ideology is decentralization.

612
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:08,720
And it turns out that there were a lot of people who gave a lot of money

613
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,720
to a centralized system, led by a madman.

614
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,720
So, it didn't go well.

615
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,720
But we hope that it will get better from now on.

616
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,720
This system cannot be a decentralized system.

617
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,720
There are necessarily intermediaries that recreate themselves,

618
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:34,720
and they re-centralize themselves in the mess, in insecurity,

619
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,720
with a lot of scams that benefit from it.

620
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,720
The architecture is not mature.

621
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,720
I'm not an expert enough to say,

622
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,720
or to be able to predict whether there will be a crypto renewal or not,

623
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,720
beyond the daily fluctuations in the value of cryptocurrencies.

624
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,720
But I think we are far from maturity,

625
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:03,720
and we are far from the moment when I would advise my baker to open a crypto account.

626
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,720
What I find interesting as a discussion, for example,

627
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,720
is that there are possible bridges between crypto and artificial intelligence.

628
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:18,720
In particular, we can think about things, there are theories.

629
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:27,720
Let's say that artificial intelligence becomes autonomous.

630
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,720
It can decide to take certain actions.

631
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,720
There have already been experiences of this kind.

632
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,720
We say that artificial intelligence has to do this,

633
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,720
and it is free to do what it wants, to go on the Internet.

634
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,720
There was an example where artificial intelligence paid someone on Fiverr.

635
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,720
At some point, it is very likely that artificial intelligence will have to use a currency

636
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,720
to be able to make commercial exchanges.

637
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,720
What will this currency be? It will probably be crypto, right?

638
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:13,720
Personally, I don't want artificial intelligence to be totally hidden and uncontrollable financial wallets.

639
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,720
Because if artificial intelligence became autonomous

640
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,720
and had access to hidden financial resources,

641
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,720
or easy to hide, because the crypto world is very easy to hide,

642
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:31,720
and to hide money in the crypto world is very easy for an AI.

643
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,720
In my opinion, we would take great risks.

644
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,720
So I think it is better to disconnect the financial sphere of the AI,

645
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,720
if we have an autonomous AI in the future,

646
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,720
so as to avoid it being full of resources to buy politicians,

647
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:49,720
to buy journalists, to carry out secret actions, to seek to take power.

648
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:55,720
I think it would be a mistake to give autonomy to an inviolable,

649
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:01,720
ultra-complex and very easy-to-hide financial system like the crypto world.

650
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,720
Excuse me, I just want to interrupt this point.

651
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:13,720
Mr. Alexandre, the blockchain is the complete opposite,

652
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,720
in the sense that there is a huge transparency,

653
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,720
there is a phenomenon of immutability in the sense that it is very difficult

654
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,720
to replay what has already been written,

655
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,720
and there is still a phenomenon of what they call a resistant sensor chip,

656
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,720
you know, resistant to censorship.

657
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:37,720
And when you say that on the contrary, it allows you to hide money,

658
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,720
in fact it is quite the opposite.

659
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:46,720
The code is the law, a transfer from A to B will remain a transfer from A to B.

660
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,720
Everyone can look at it and repeat it.

661
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,720
I just wanted to make a point.

662
00:42:53,720 --> 00:43:00,720
We are not talking about greed or the fact that prices go down or up,

663
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,720
but more about the use of AI on technology itself,

664
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,720
not stealing from your neighbor or doing scams.

665
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,720
I have long adhered to this discourse.

666
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,720
I have long been convinced that the crypto universe was a universe of transparency.

667
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,720
But with the arrival of platforms and intermediaries,

668
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,720
which we saw the bankruptcy,

669
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:29,720
we realized that behind the fact that all transactions were open, traceable,

670
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:34,720
we could move billions of dollars in cash inside the platform.

671
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,720
We can see that in reality the announced transparency is not absolute.

672
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
But here we are no longer on the blockchain.

673
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,720
As soon as it touches FTX, we are no longer on the blockchain technology.

674
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,720
Intermediaries are not necessary to the AI to be able to transfer money.

675
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,720
The blockchain system has shown that it does not work without intermediaries,

676
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,720
and that layers of intermediation were coming,

677
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,720
and that these layers of intermediation were not transparent.

678
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,720
So yes, the blockchain is theoretically transparent,

679
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:10,720
but I think an AI would have the intellectual resources to hide transactions

680
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,720
without realizing it.

681
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,720
I am convinced of this.

682
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,720
And on the other hand, above the transparent part,

683
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,720
non-transparent layers of intermediation have appeared,

684
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:29,720
and I don't believe that a financial system can do without intermediary layers.

685
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,720
So I am generally worried.

686
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,720
Even if I have adhered to your discourse in the past,

687
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,720
I no longer adhere to it today,

688
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:42,720
given that intermediary layers have mechanically recreated themselves

689
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,720
above the transparent system.

690
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,720
Good evening, can you hear me?

691
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,720
Yes, we can hear you.

692
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,720
Good evening, Laurent Alexandre.

693
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,720
So, first of all, nice to have you here,

694
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,720
because my father is particularly a fan of you,

695
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,720
and I was able to listen to what you said about artificial intelligence,

696
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,720
and I thought it was very relevant.

697
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,720
I quite agree with you.

698
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,720
I think we can use the blockchain in a transparent way,

699
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,720
not on every part, but on this part specifically.

700
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,720
And if one day we assume that AI will be smarter than us,

701
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,720
or relatively smart,

702
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,720
for them, using the blockchain is super native,

703
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,720
because it is programming, literally.

704
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,720
And so they could very easily hide it.

705
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,720
I can see how we could prevent them from using the blockchain,

706
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,720
the bitcoin, etc., if they have the capacity one day.

707
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,720
And I will come back to another point that has nothing to do with what you said earlier.

708
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,720
First of all, it was good, because you said a lot of things that are not very politically correct,

709
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,720
and personally I appreciate it, because we are in a world where everyone says politically correct things,

710
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,720
so it's a bit tiring at times.

711
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:50,720
And you made the remark that robots would cost a lot less than poor workers.

712
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,720
I don't really agree, because in the end, a human being,

713
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,720
let's say close to the minimum wage in the world,

714
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,720
actually doesn't cost much more than a few bags of food,

715
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,720
and in the end it costs a lot less than manufacturing robots, maintaining them, etc.

716
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:10,720
And we see that the cheapest factories in the world are in countries where we are not going to install robots,

717
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,720
but we are just going to put humans that cost a lot less than machines.

718
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,720
Sorry, I said several things, it was a bit dense.

719
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:22,720
Don't forget that wages are rising a lot in third world countries,

720
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,720
especially in Asia, more in Asia than in Africa,

721
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,720
and especially in sub-Saharan Africa.

722
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,720
But in the end, there will be an equalization of wages.

723
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:37,720
And the problem with competition is that we are not in a competition with robots from the 90s or 2000s.

724
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,720
We are going to have super intelligent robots,

725
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,720
which will, for a marginal cost, have LLM of the future.

726
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:51,720
So it's true, but I have a feeling that the problem with robots is that their bodies cost a lot.

727
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:56,720
It's not their intelligence, it's making a mechanical body.

728
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,720
I have the impression that it is extremely difficult, especially to make it as flexible as humans.

729
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,720
For a simple reason, it's that the volumes were bad.

730
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:15,720
Polyvalent robotics, Boston Dynamics, I'm not talking about the 1985 Renault robot,

731
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,720
always does the same gesture year after year.

732
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,720
The volumes of polyvalent robotics were bad.

733
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,720
So earlier I talked about uncertainty on robotics.

734
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,720
I don't know if there will be enough volumes on robotics to meet the costs.

735
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,720
But if there are domestic robots in the future, they will be very competitive.

736
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:39,720
To have a robot at home, equipped with GPT-5,

737
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:45,720
capable of solving all the problems of the family and in addition to doing the homework to the children,

738
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,720
it will be very profitable.

739
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,720
It's possible, I'm not sure.

740
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,720
If there is a collapse in costs, it is linked to large volumes.

741
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,720
If there are no volumes, the costs will remain very high.

742
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,720
But don't forget that a polyvalent robot could do a lot of homework.

743
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:09,720
And I think it could be very competitive.

744
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:16,720
I imagine that a polyvalent robot could see its cost fall below 5,000 euros in the future,

745
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,720
if humanoid domestic robotics develops.

746
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,720
At that price, it will be very competitive for the middle and upper classes.

747
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:33,720
I'm skeptical because I think that the minimum cost, the bottom of a human being,

748
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,720
is barely enough to feed.

749
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,720
And in the end, it costs very little.

750
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,720
You're not going to have the housecleaning done with Pakistan's robots.

751
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,720
We agree.

752
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:55,720
You compare the price of a sandal factory for Bangladesh workers

753
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,720
with the price of a housewife or a carpenter in Paris.

754
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,720
Absolutely.

755
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:08,720
You have to compare the Parisian housewife, who is 1.5 times the SMIG,

756
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,720
with your robot.

757
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,720
You will see that you will amortize your robot

758
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:20,720
and that you cannot have your house cleaned by Bengali or Bangladeshi workers.

759
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,720
My housewife is Moldovan, but I pay her.

760
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,720
She is a Parisian housewife.

761
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:36,720
She is subject to social and legal harassment.

762
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,720
Thank you very much for your answer.

763
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,720
Very interesting.

764
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:48,720
Just a little point, if I may, to return to the Conex subject,

765
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,720
on the economic models that future AI could employ.

766
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,720
If we talk about a very simple observation,

767
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,720
it is perhaps that these AI of the future will want to commercialize each other,

768
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,720
in one way or another.

769
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,720
They will keep a kind of governance, of consciousness,

770
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,720
perhaps decentralized.

771
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,720
And that's where I come back to the big shoes.

772
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,720
The blockchain would be a fairly logical solution

773
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,720
to create the economic models that would link,

774
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,720
that would interconnect all the AI.

775
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,720
I am not a technophobe, I am not a bioconservative,

776
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:29,720
but I think that it is necessary to prohibit AI from having access to our accounts without control.

777
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,720
It is necessary to prohibit AI from being able to make financial exchanges,

778
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,720
because very quickly we will not be able to control them.

779
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,720
Because the human control time is very, very slow

780
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,720
compared to the speed at which AI is able to control,

781
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,720
to organize transactions.

782
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,720
So I think we have to be very, very careful.

783
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,720
So, from the point of view of AI, you are right.

784
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,720
From the point of view of humanity, which is the point of view I take there,

785
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:57,720
I think we take a deadly risk if we enter this logic.

786
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,720
Can you explain why it is a deadly risk, as you say?

787
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,720
In the hypothesis that we cannot exclude today,

788
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,720
that artificial consciousness is coming,

789
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,720
and that super intelligence is coming.

790
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,720
I remind you of Sam Altman's prophecy this summer,

791
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,720
which is on his blog.

792
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,720
You can all read the article that Sam Altman wrote on it.

793
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,720
Super intelligence will be there before 2030.

794
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,720
That is, in 2000 days.

795
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,720
In the hypothesis that you have artificial super intelligence,

796
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:33,720
that you cannot let it take control of finances,

797
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,720
I think the financial circuit must remain manual,

798
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,720
so as to prevent that there is accumulation of money,

799
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,720
even if it is only to corrupt people.

800
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:48,720
If AI has the ability to organize financial transactions,

801
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,720
it can buy politicians to take power.

802
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,720
In the hypothesis that we have autonomous super intelligence,

803
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,720
I place myself in the hypothesis evoked by Sam Altman.

804
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,720
Yes, I think it would be very dangerous.

805
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,720
If you want, given the progress of AI in recent months,

806
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,720
and given the prospects of AI,

807
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,720
of general artificial intelligence,

808
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,720
in the relatively short term,

809
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:19,720
and perhaps super intelligence relatively quickly,

810
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,720
I think we need to be careful.

811
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,720
I am not in the current psychosis,

812
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:29,720
and I do not believe that GPT-6 will exterminate humanity,

813
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,720
but I think we need to start being careful,

814
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,720
never forgetting that the human brain is very, very slow,

815
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:40,720
and that we will not see a complicated plot led by AI.

816
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,720
So, if we think 50 years, 100 years,

817
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,720
we must already have a strategy to minimize risks,

818
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,720
and the simplest way to prevent a serious accident,

819
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,720
in my opinion,

820
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:57,720
is to prevent the financial autonomy of super intelligence,

821
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,720
if it should happen.

822
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,720
I have a question about that.

823
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,720
Don't you think that from the moment it is technically possible,

824
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,720
it will happen anyway?

825
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,720
The answer is yes.

826
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:21,720
We have never seen a working moratorium,

827
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,720
but we can organize technology to avoid these bad sides.

828
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,720
We have not prevented nuclear dissuasion,

829
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,720
nuclear diffusion, nuclear dissemination,

830
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,720
however, we have prevented nuclear war since 1945.

831
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,720
We can imagine that we are not preventing super intelligence,

832
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,720
but that we are organizing society in a way

833
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:44,720
to control the use of super intelligence in the future.

834
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,720
Obviously, it is easier to control the atomic bomb

835
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,720
than super intelligence,

836
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,720
because the atomic bomb obeys us,

837
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,720
whereas super intelligence would not necessarily obey us,

838
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:59,720
in the case where it would have an agentivity,

839
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:02,720
a cognitive autonomy, an intellectual one,

840
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,720
and its own agenda.

841
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,720
So, without falling into the psychosis of a Geoffrey Hinton

842
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,720
who sees the end of the world as a Harry in every corner of the street,

843
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,720
I think that we must be careful

844
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,720
and that there should be an international reflection,

845
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,720
even if, like everyone else,

846
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,720
I have observed that Bletchley's speech gave nothing,

847
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:31,720
except for making a little more publicity to Elon Musk,

848
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,720
who managed to have a debate for more than an hour

849
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,720
with the British Prime Minister, Sonnac.

850
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,720
Yes, because that's it.

851
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,720
There is another theory of the relationship

852
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,720
that cryptos can maintain with AI.

853
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:50,720
It is the idea that AI would be hosted

854
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,720
on decentralized servers,

855
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,720
on infrastructures that we use,

856
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,720
that we will use in our everyday lives.

857
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,720
And at that moment, like the thing you were talking about,

858
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:07,720
we could never turn off an AI that would be…

859
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,720
Anyway, the idea that we will allow everyone

860
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,720
to have an open source AI server in their kitchen

861
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,720
is a politically delusional idea.

862
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,720
Yes, but the incentive takes a few minutes.

863
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,720
If you pay these people tokens

864
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,720
and that there is value on the market, it will go very quickly.

865
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,720
Yes, I hear you well.

866
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,720
People will go to jail because the state

867
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,720
keeps the monopoly on direct violence.

868
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,720
And the people who will set up

869
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:41,720
the so-called strong, decentralized AI infrastructures

870
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,720
will be put in jail.

871
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,720
And that will calm them down,

872
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,720
because the state is able to put people in jail.

873
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:53,720
And so if tomorrow the Facebook or Google boss

874
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,720
makes decentralized AI,

875
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,720
he will be put in jail.

876
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,720
The same way that if you make the atomic bomb in your kitchen,

877
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,720
you will be put in jail.

878
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,720
And if you make the variole virus,

879
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,720
which is very easy to do,

880
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,720
it costs $100,000 to make the variole virus,

881
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,720
it has been demonstrated by Canadian researchers,

882
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,720
you will go to jail.

883
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,720
So AI cannot be decentralized.

884
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,720
Its use can be decentralized,

885
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,720
but its production cannot be decentralized

886
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,720
beyond a certain threshold.

887
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,720
So I don't know if the good thresholds

888
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,720
are those that were announced by Joe Biden a week ago,

889
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,720
but it is clear that you will not let people

890
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,720
have a computer in their kitchen

891
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,720
producing at the IAEA without filters

892
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,720
and able to give you the recipe for the atomic bomb

893
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,720
and the recipe for the variole virus.

894
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,720
You will set up filters.

895
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,720
We saw that the GPT has done a lot of work

896
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,720
to lock up the problem of poisons.

897
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,720
A team from Penn & High was dedicated

898
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,720
to prevent each GPT from giving the recipe for new poisons.

899
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,720
But don't you think it's a shame?

900
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,720
It's as if we were deleting the Internet

901
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,720
because 3% of people will use it in a bad way.

902
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,720
Wait a second.

903
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,720
And so it was complicated for each GPT

904
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,720
to set up filter systems

905
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,720
so that GPT4 never answers the question

906
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,720
give me ideas of deadly chemical products

907
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,720
for the human species

908
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,720
and explain to me how to make them.

909
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:27,720
Well, GPT4 does not answer this type of question

910
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,720
because a specific team at Penn & High

911
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,720
worked on it before the release of GPT4

912
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,720
on March 15, 2023.

913
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,720
So it may be a shame not to decentralize the IAEA

914
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,720
in open source,

915
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,720
but society will not do it.

916
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,720
It will only allow decentralization

917
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,720
in an extremely frustrating form of IAEA.

918
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,720
It will not allow people to locally manufacture

919
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,720
computer viruses or ultra-dangerous biological viruses.

920
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,720
It will not allow people to do research

921
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,720
with deleterious and toxic bugs for humanity.

922
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,720
Politics will prohibit the decentralization

923
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,720
of IAEAs superior to GPT4 or GPT5.

924
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,720
I am absolutely convinced of this.

925
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:21,720
Even if 99% of its use is for the right cause?

926
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:27,720
If 99% of people who make an atomic bomb in their garage

927
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:32,720
use it only to wedge an old mattress

928
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,720
and that only 1% of people blow up their atomic bomb

929
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,720
and destroy their city,

930
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,720
it is very, very, very, very, very serious.

931
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,720
With a demurgical technology,

932
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,720
even if only 1 million people

933
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,720
use homo-deus technology poorly,

934
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,720
you have a disaster.

935
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:53,720
You have a total asymmetry between IAEA,

936
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,720
homo-deus technology,

937
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,720
and non-demurgical technologies.

938
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,720
With a demurgical technology,

939
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,720
having only 1% of people making fun is unacceptable.

940
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,720
Having 1 in 1,000 people making fun is unbearable.

941
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,720
Having 1 in 1,000,000 people making fun is unbearable.

942
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,720
Having 1 in 1,000,000 people making fun is unbearable.

943
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,720
And it leads to the end of the world.

944
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,720
So you have a complete asymmetry

945
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:25,720
between homo-deus technologies and non-demurgical technologies.

946
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,720
And you have to keep that in mind.

947
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,720
I think you are quite optimistic

948
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,720
about the role of states

949
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:41,720
in the future of AI, especially since

950
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,720
there are too many states.

951
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,720
There are 200 countries.

952
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,720
There is always a way to bypass the rules.

953
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,720
I don't know how you can believe

954
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:55,720
that a government or governments

955
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,720
will be able to regulate this.

956
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,720
Did I say it would be easy?

957
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:04,720
Are international relations easy?

958
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,720
Are our relations with Afghanistan easy?

959
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:13,720
Is the Israeli-Hamas crisis easy to resolve?

960
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:18,720
Is the crisis between Ukraine and Russia easy to resolve?

961
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,720
No.

962
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:23,720
International relations are the realm of real politics.

963
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,720
It's not the realm of teddy bears.

964
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,720
It's the world of testosterone.

965
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,720
It's not the world of kindness.

966
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:35,720
International relations applied to AI

967
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,720
will be extremely rough.

968
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:40,720
There will be virile discussions.

969
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,720
Some states will blackmail people

970
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,720
into leaving AI to piss them off.

971
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,720
Terrorists will be supported by their states.

972
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:54,720
Terrorists will try to produce dangerous AI

973
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,720
for political or religious reasons.

974
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,720
There will be nihilist groups

975
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,720
who will try to leave AI.

976
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,720
40 years ago, a group of nihilists

977
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,720
put sarin in the subway.

978
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,720
Its leader was executed.

979
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,720
He was sentenced to death in Japan.

980
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,720
But he wanted to kill as many people

981
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,720
as possible by putting neurotoxic gases in the subway.

982
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,720
He wanted to stop the end of the world.

983
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,720
It didn't work out because the sarin in the subway

984
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,720
wasn't very well spread.

985
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,720
There were a few deaths, but not many.

986
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,720
But there will be nihilist groups

987
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,720
like that in the era of artificial intelligence,

988
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,720
as there have always been.

989
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:34,720
In the past, there have been many nihilist groups.

990
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,720
In the Arab-Muslim world,

991
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,720
there were people who killed at random in the Middle Ages

992
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,720
by religious nihilism.

993
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,720
These were the people they met.

994
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,720
So, it's not a new problem.

995
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,720
We will have a lot of difficulties.

996
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,720
It will occupy us for a while.

997
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,720
We must never forget that artificial intelligence

998
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,720
is not a problem for 6 months,

999
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,720
5 years,

1000
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,720
50 years,

1001
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,720
or 5,000 years.

1002
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,720
Our cohabitation with artificial intelligence

1003
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,720
will always be a problem in a billion years.

1004
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,720
It's not a problem that will stop.

1005
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,720
So, the synergies, whatever the form,

1006
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,720
between AI and biological intelligence,

1007
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,720
which could lead to the disappearance

1008
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:22,720
of human intelligence, maybe one day,

1009
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,720
or to its fusion with artificial intelligence

1010
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,720
in the form of cyborgization,

1011
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,720
the relations will be complicated

1012
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,720
and will be durably complicated.

1013
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,720
So, we must not roll on the ground

1014
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,720
and start to cry the first day.

1015
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,720
We have these difficulties of managing artificial intelligence

1016
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,720
on our backs

1017
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,720
at least for the next billion years.

1018
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:50,720
So, yes, it will be very hot

1019
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,720
and it will be a subject of continuous concern

1020
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,720
for humanity because we are not able

1021
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,720
to stop AI

1022
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:01,720
and we will have to live with it

1023
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,720
under partial control,

1024
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,720
if only because our ability

1025
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,720
to predict the evolution of AI is zero.

1026
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:15,720
That's what worries politicians.

1027
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:18,720
The fact that no one has seen the scalability

1028
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,720
of LLM is very worrying

1029
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,720
because it is quite possible

1030
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,720
that we will not see the next steps.

1031
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:30,720
For now, the most serious studies show

1032
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,720
that there is no significant emergent property in GPT-4

1033
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,720
or artificial consciousness,

1034
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,720
we suspected that,

1035
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,720
but in the future, we can imagine

1036
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,720
that there are AI, not necessarily LLM,

1037
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,720
which are emerging properties

1038
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,720
that develop without us realizing it.

1039
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,720
Monitoring the arrival of AI

1040
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:55,720
could be very complicated.

1041
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:58,720
We are just starting to think about these issues

1042
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:04,720
and I share what Nick Bostrom said,

1043
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,720
we are 30 years behind,

1044
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:13,720
we should have started thinking about AI control in 1990,

1045
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,720
civil society and politicians

1046
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,720
were not interested,

1047
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,720
we have to think about it now.

1048
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,720
I know you told me before the show

1049
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,720
that you could stay for an hour,

1050
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,720
if you agree to stay a little longer,

1051
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,720
I can take questions from the audience.

1052
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:32,720
Yes, OK.

1053
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,720
I did not do it,

1054
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,720
there are people who asked me for the floor

1055
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,720
during the show,

1056
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,720
I did not accept, sorry friends,

1057
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,720
because I wanted to manage the watch.

1058
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,720
If there are some of you who want to react

1059
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,720
on things that were said during the show,

1060
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,720
ask me the speaker role now,

1061
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,720
I will give you the floor.

1062
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,720
Just try to be relevant and concise.

1063
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,720
Not me, games in my life,

1064
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:00,720
very short and very relevant please.

1065
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,720
While waiting for people to ask me,

1066
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:08,720
I wanted to ask you a question,

1067
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,720
because it's a topic you addressed on Tinkerview,

1068
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,720
and I thought it was great that you address this question,

1069
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,720
because it's something I thought a lot about.

1070
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,720
Do you think it's possible,

1071
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,720
I know the answer a little bit,

1072
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,720
do you think it's possible

1073
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:27,720
that humanity is just a passing thing

1074
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:32,720
and that we are just there to create robots?

1075
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:36,720
I have long hoped for the opposite.

1076
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:42,720
Our inability to define a good strategy against AI,

1077
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,720
our inability to think beyond the limits of education

1078
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,720
and to overcome the limits of education,

1079
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:53,720
the extremely fast development of AI,

1080
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,720
the very strong scalability of AI,

1081
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,720
to use a term I have already used,

1082
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,720
make me doubt.

1083
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:06,720
In a previous book, I wrote

1084
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,720
that we must save the Michelin Guide,

1085
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,720
that we must avoid the cyborgization of man,

1086
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:17,720
and we must keep a libido, appetite,

1087
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:20,720
we must keep our human, biological passions

1088
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,720
linked to the presence of our physical body.

1089
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:28,720
Today, I have the impression

1090
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,720
that the battle is being lost,

1091
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:35,720
and that in reality, as Musk said for a long time,

1092
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:38,720
human intelligence, the human neuron,

1093
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:43,720
is the hard drive for the start of AI.

1094
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:47,720
Because it is clear that an AI cannot be made

1095
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:51,720
from a pile of stones on a planet,

1096
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:56,720
whereas life can appear relatively quickly on a planet,

1097
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,720
in a very simple form at the beginning,

1098
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,720
with increasing sophistication.

1099
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:08,720
The neuron appeared on Earth about 550 million years ago,

1100
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,720
life being a little less than 4 billion years.

1101
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:16,720
So we had 3.5 billion years without neurons.

1102
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:21,720
It takes time for the Darwinian selection to lead to neurons.

1103
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,720
So the neuron is 550 million years old,

1104
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:30,720
human conceptual intelligence is about 200-250 thousand years old,

1105
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,720
and the transistor was born in 1947,

1106
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,720
which won the Nobel Prize at Schöckle,

1107
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,720
and GPT 3.5 less than a year later.

1108
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,720
So we see that the neuron's rhythm is very slow

1109
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,720
compared to the rhythm of artificial intelligence.

1110
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,720
Today we are very clearly above artificial intelligence,

1111
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,720
even if it is above us on a regular basis.

1112
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,720
We are not yet facing the AI,

1113
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,720
but the AI is progressing much faster than us,

1114
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,720
even if we are the parents, it doesn't change anything.

1115
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:06,720
In the great debate that was developed in Mosk's biography,

1116
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,720
between Larry Page and Mosk,

1117
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:13,720
Larry Page explained that the time of the biological brain was over,

1118
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,720
that we should not be obstinate,

1119
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,720
that we should now leave the time to the AI

1120
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:22,720
because the biological brain could not be competitive,

1121
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:28,720
with Mosk explaining that we should increase man,

1122
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:31,720
that's why he created Neuralink,

1123
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,720
that we should increase man to save the biological body

1124
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:38,720
and avoid the control of AI.

1125
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:44,720
In this debate, I have long hoped that Mosk could be right.

1126
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,720
The more it's been going on in recent months,

1127
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:51,720
the more I think Larry Page is right, even if I regret it.

1128
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:55,720
I would like the Michelin Guide not to disappear.

1129
01:08:55,720 --> 01:09:00,720
I am afraid that it will disappear and that the biological neuron will lose the battle,

1130
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:04,720
not tomorrow morning, but in 500 years, in 1000 years, in 5000 years.

1131
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:07,720
I don't see how we could last very long,

1132
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,720
even with intracerebral prostheses,

1133
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:14,720
even if Neuralink worked one day in neuro enhancement.

1134
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,720
The limitations of our intellectual capacities,

1135
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:20,720
the limitations of our amnesic capacities,

1136
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:25,720
the biological limitations of the neuron are very, very strong.

1137
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:29,720
We cannot significantly increase the number of neurons,

1138
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:36,720
we cannot increase the speed of electro-biochemical conduction in our brain,

1139
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,720
our amnesic capacity is very limited,

1140
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:43,720
we cannot absolutely retain the whole web,

1141
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:49,720
while AI can have the whole web as a window of attention.

1142
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:53,720
All this makes me doubt.

1143
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:56,720
I am afraid that Larry Page is right,

1144
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:59,720
that the future is a non-biological intelligence,

1145
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:03,720
and I am very sad about it.

1146
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:07,720
Thank you very much for this long answer.

1147
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:11,720
I see people who asked me for the role of speaker,

1148
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:14,720
the problem is that I can't accept them,

1149
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:17,720
that's why I gave you Laurent from MEV Capital,

1150
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,720
I put you host, I don't know if you see them,

1151
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,720
if you can accept people, but it doesn't work for me.

1152
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,720
As soon as I see someone, with pleasure.

1153
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:32,720
Twitter Space is known for having bugs all the time,

1154
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,720
I'm not even surprised by that.

1155
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:38,720
I don't know if Riku or Quarle wanted to ask a question,

1156
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:41,720
but I'm sorry for those who wanted to ask questions,

1157
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,720
I can't accept you, I see 4 people waiting.

1158
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:47,720
Good evening.

1159
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,720
It was very interesting, good evening sir.

1160
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:53,720
It's true that from your speech,

1161
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:56,720
we want to intervene, either to overdo it,

1162
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,720
or to add something, it's not easy,

1163
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:04,720
because we are many here, and we can't all speak.

1164
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,720
Artificial intelligence is problematic,

1165
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,720
because it raises a lot of questions,

1166
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:14,720
and we wonder if it will not go beyond us.

1167
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:21,720
It will go beyond us.

1168
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:26,720
There is no AI expert who thinks that AI will not go beyond us.

1169
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:30,720
The debate between Hinton, Bengio and Lequin,

1170
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,720
is not about going beyond.

1171
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:38,720
Even Lequin has explained many times that AI will go beyond us.

1172
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,720
The debate today is between Lequin,

1173
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:45,720
who says we are entering the light, and AI will never be hostile,

1174
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,720
and then Bengio and Hinton,

1175
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:51,720
the other two co-creators of deep neural networks,

1176
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:54,720
who see the end of the world in a short time,

1177
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,720
if we don't regulate AI strongly.

1178
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,720
So we will be outdone.

1179
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,720
I am not an expert, I have not read anything,

1180
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,720
going in the opposite direction.

1181
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:09,720
Everyone is convinced that AI will go beyond us,

1182
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:12,720
and that it will at least reach the AGI.

1183
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,720
Not necessarily in a thousand days,

1184
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:18,720
not necessarily in 2000 days, but at the end of the next decade.

1185
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:21,720
So the debate is no longer so much about whether we are going to be outdone,

1186
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,720
we are going to be.

1187
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:26,720
In medicine, I am outdone by AI.

1188
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,720
Strongly outdone.

1189
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:32,720
I was telling you earlier how I tested a nurse with GPT-4

1190
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,720
versus me without GPT-4.

1191
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:38,720
I am outdone.

1192
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:41,720
It's not the nurse.

1193
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,720
Where it's scary,

1194
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:47,720
is where we have awareness.

1195
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,720
For automation,

1196
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,720
to do very fast calculations,

1197
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,720
we had to have a very high level of knowledge.

1198
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,720
We knew that computer science

1199
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:02,720
was capable of surprising things,

1200
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:05,720
but today we are at a turning point.

1201
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:08,720
It's about creativity.

1202
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:11,720
Writing books,

1203
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,720
creating pictorial works,

1204
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,720
maybe soon animation,

1205
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:20,720
or maybe making films, we don't know.

1206
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,720
And that's where I think humans feel a little outdone.

1207
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:26,720
It's as much enthusiasm

1208
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,720
as it's scary.

1209
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:32,720
On innovation,

1210
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:35,720
if you want to be a little scared,

1211
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:38,720
read the Wall Street Journal article

1212
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:41,720
three weeks ago

1213
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:44,720
detailing the study that was done in Wharton.

1214
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:47,720
We opposed the students

1215
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,720
of the Wharton MBA,

1216
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:53,720
which is the third or fourth best MBA in the world,

1217
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:56,720
according to the years, with GPT-4.

1218
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:59,720
In the definition of original ideas,

1219
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:02,720
new ideas, new business and marketing concepts.

1220
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:05,720
GPT-4 has crushed the students of the Wharton MBA

1221
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:08,720
who are among the best students in the United States of America.

1222
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:11,720
So on creativity,

1223
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:14,720
things are more worrying than we imagined.

1224
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:17,720
The LLM are very innovative,

1225
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,720
they have a lot of original ideas.

1226
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,720
Last night I was telling this

1227
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:26,720
to a friend of mine

1228
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:29,720
who is a politician.

1229
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:32,720
I was very struck last week.

1230
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:35,720
I asked GPT-4

1231
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,720
to imagine the next book

1232
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:41,720
by Laurent Lextrand.

1233
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:44,720
And to summarize,

1234
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:47,720
I asked him to pitch.

1235
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:50,720
And GPT-4

1236
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:53,720
found a title that was close to my new book.

1237
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:59,720
And in addition,

1238
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:02,720
it made a summary of this new book

1239
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:05,720
that is very close to the plan of my next book.

1240
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:08,720
Not The War of the Intelligences by Chet GPT,

1241
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,720
but the next one coming out in April 2024.

1242
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,720
And I am very happy to have GPT-4

1243
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:17,720
approach the title of my new book

1244
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:20,720
and the content of my new book.

1245
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:23,720
This proves that he has a prospective thinking

1246
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:26,720
in relation to what he knows

1247
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:29,720
about my previous books,

1248
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:32,720
which is quite strong.

1249
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,720
And that is very disturbing.

1250
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:38,720
Because if I ask a human being

1251
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:41,720
to do something,

1252
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,720
he will not do it.

1253
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:47,720
GPT-4 is disturbing.

1254
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,720
Do you have a reluctance

1255
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,720
that Chet GPT

1256
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:56,720
can feed on your works,

1257
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,720
your writings,

1258
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,720
and can anticipate your next works?

1259
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:05,720
So, if he has access to my books,

1260
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:08,720
I am very happy.

1261
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:11,720
If he reads my books, I am very happy.

1262
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:14,720
I am just troubled that by reading

1263
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,720
what has been written about my books

1264
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:20,720
and what has been written about me

1265
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:23,720
and what is on the web,

1266
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:26,720
he can predict what I will produce in the future.

1267
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:29,720
Let's say that someone else

1268
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:32,720
does this work,

1269
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:35,720
which is not really a complicated job.

1270
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,720
It's just giving Chet GPT

1271
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:41,720
or other people the content of your writings

1272
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,720
and asking them to produce a new work.

1273
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:47,720
It will be done.

1274
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:50,720
The creators will be challenged by the AI

1275
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:53,720
and also by men who will ask the AI

1276
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:56,720
to do plagiarism

1277
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:59,720
or to do a mitou of what other intellectuals do.

1278
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:02,720
It will be very troubling for the intellectuals.

1279
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:05,720
We are only at the beginning of this situation.

1280
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,720
I have a friend

1281
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:11,720
who is a very high-ranking civil servant.

1282
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:14,720
One of my friends from the National Assembly

1283
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,720
who has a very important position in the State Department.

1284
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:20,720
I won't say who it is.

1285
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,720
The first letter of his name.

1286
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:26,720
I am joking.

1287
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:29,720
It will be very difficult

1288
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:32,720
when the minister's surface tacticians

1289
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:35,720
will come up with a 200-page plan

1290
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,720
that they will have written by GPT-6.

1291
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,720
What will we have to do?

1292
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:44,720
When the carpenter will come

1293
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:47,720
to the Ministry of Research with a plan

1294
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:50,720
that he has written by GPT-6

1295
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,720
to reform the Ministry,

1296
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,720
to reorganize the CNRS.

1297
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,720
If that makes sense, there is nothing wrong with it.

1298
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,720
There is nothing alarming.

1299
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,720
It doesn't make sense because it's GPT-6 that he wrote.

1300
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:08,720
It's not a work of a carpenter.

1301
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:11,720
So what?

1302
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:14,720
We will be overwhelmed with billions of pages

1303
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:17,720
that will be produced by people

1304
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:20,720
who will have just pressed a button on GPT-6.

1305
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:23,720
When all the average people will have 5,000 pages per day

1306
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:26,720
written by GPT-6.

1307
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:29,720
But for good reason, sir.

1308
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,720
You explained earlier that in the class struggle

1309
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:35,720
and in intellectual inequalities,

1310
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:38,720
it risks digging a little more the gap.

1311
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:41,720
And I think that these people who can generate writings,

1312
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:44,720
will they be able to understand them above all?

1313
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,720
The answer is no, of course.

1314
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:50,720
But there won't be enough time for the Minister's staff.

1315
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:53,720
To do the execution.

1316
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:56,720
We can write 200 pages,

1317
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:59,720
but then there is the execution.

1318
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:02,720
It's not the AI that will do it.

1319
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:05,720
I didn't say the opposite.

1320
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:08,720
I said that we will be overwhelmed with content produced by the middle management

1321
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:11,720
that will actually have been done by GPT-6.

1322
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:14,720
And if you want, when you are a manager in a company,

1323
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,720
if all the middle managers under you

1324
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:20,720
make you write 5,000 pages per day,

1325
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:23,720
it will be complicated to manage.

1326
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:26,720
We have important cognitive obesity in the future.

1327
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:29,720
In fact, it is enough to use AI to absorb all these pages

1328
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:32,720
that are sent by these people who have used other AI.

1329
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:35,720
There is still a danger,

1330
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:38,720
which is that all the political and entrepreneurial decisions

1331
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:41,720
are in IA and IA-IQ loops.

1332
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:45,720
Without humans inside.

1333
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:48,720
For the simple and good reason that no human will be able to read

1334
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:51,720
a billion pages a day.

1335
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,720
So, what will be the role of humans?

1336
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:57,720
It will be the decision-making.

1337
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:00,720
I'm not sure.

1338
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,720
In a plane, it's not the pilot who decides.

1339
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:06,720
And fortunately, because the pilot is not able to decide

1340
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:09,720
what to do,

1341
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:13,720
the data is not being interpreted in real time.

1342
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,720
In an Airbus A350, there are 5,000 sensors.

1343
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:19,720
It produces teraoctets of data.

1344
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:22,720
No human being is able to aggregate the data.

1345
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:25,720
So, the pilot does not decide.

1346
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,720
And I remind you that the last time the pilot decided

1347
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,720
instead of the on-board computer, we were in the ocean.

1348
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:34,720
So, I'm not at all sure that the decision will remain human.

1349
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:37,720
I would like that in medicine,

1350
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:41,720
the final decision is made by the doctor.

1351
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:44,720
But I'm a cancerologist.

1352
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:47,720
The DNA sequencing of a tumor is 20 teraoctets.

1353
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:50,720
It's 20 billion octets.

1354
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:53,720
20 billion data.

1355
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:56,720
I can make you believe that I'm going to read

1356
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:59,720
the 20 billion data before choosing chemotherapy.

1357
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:02,720
But that would be a lie.

1358
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:05,720
Even if I make a conclusion,

1359
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:09,720
even if I make a long consultation,

1360
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:12,720
8 minutes,

1361
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:15,720
I'm not going to read 20 billion data in 8 minutes

1362
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:18,720
by interpreting them

1363
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:21,720
and by crossing them with the rest of the medical file

1364
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:24,720
which will also inflate with the sensors,

1365
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:27,720
with the data-driven medicine,

1366
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:30,720
personalized medicine, etc.

1367
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:33,720
So, in reality, to think that we will keep the decision

1368
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:37,720
in a world where there will be a billion times more data

1369
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:40,720
than our brain is capable of processing,

1370
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:43,720
is an illusion.

1371
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:46,720
I think that's already the case.

1372
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:49,720
Yes, but it's not to the degree it is today.

1373
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:52,720
The maximum capacity for absorption

1374
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:55,720
or integration of information

1375
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:58,720
for an average brain

1376
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:01,720
has already been exceeded.

1377
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:05,720
So, on that note, I think we're already...

1378
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:08,720
It has been barely exceeded.

1379
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:11,720
Today, there are still many areas where you can make a decision

1380
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:14,720
because there is not yet too much data.

1381
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:17,720
Tomorrow, there will be many areas

1382
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:20,720
where we will be saturated on the cognitive level.

1383
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:23,720
I see that there are two great experts

1384
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:26,720
in the regulation of AI

1385
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:29,720
who are Brivell and Laodice.

1386
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:32,720
I advise you to follow them on Twitter.

1387
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:35,720
They are two exceptional people in the field of understanding.

1388
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:38,720
You know that for 30 years,

1389
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,720
in finance and in computer development,

1390
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:44,720
we have already been submerged in data

1391
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:47,720
and we have managed to manage it.

1392
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:50,720
Yes, but it is not to be generalized.

1393
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:53,720
It is not on the whole of human activity.

1394
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:56,720
The problem we will have

1395
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:59,720
is that we will have a growing part of human activity

1396
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:02,720
where we will be cognitively exceeded

1397
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:05,720
and where the volumetric data will be too important.

1398
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:08,720
We do not have the tools to regulate.

1399
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:11,720
We do not have the tools to teach people

1400
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:14,720
to manage this cognitive obesity,

1401
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:17,720
to sort out the information, which is very complicated, very difficult.

1402
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:20,720
That is why Google did not bring

1403
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:23,720
what the founders of the Internet hoped for.

1404
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:26,720
The founders of the Internet hoped

1405
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:29,720
that intellectual inequalities would collapse

1406
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:32,720
thanks to Google and thanks to the Internet.

1407
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:35,720
Since everyone would have access to all the world's knowledge for free,

1408
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:38,720
there would be no more intellectual inequalities.

1409
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:41,720
What web creators like Tim Berners-Lee

1410
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:44,720
and the founders of the search engines did not understand

1411
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:47,720
was that, on the contrary, Google increased intellectual inequalities

1412
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:50,720
because it brings too much information

1413
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:53,720
and that many people have trouble sorting out the information,

1414
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:56,720
especially because they read slowly.

1415
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:59,720
There is a bonus, even before artificial intelligence,

1416
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:02,720
to people who can read quickly,

1417
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:05,720
to sort out and hierarchize information.

1418
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:08,720
As everyone can see,

1419
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:11,720
contrary to what the founders of the Internet hoped,

1420
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:14,720
the Internet did not eliminate intellectual inequalities,

1421
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,720
it maintained them, or even increased them.

1422
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,720
This world of cognitive obesity

1423
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:24,720
is a world that may be unfair

1424
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,720
because it may increase the barrier

1425
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:30,720
between those who are able to sort out and hierarchize information

1426
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:33,720
and to properly interface human intelligence and artificial intelligence.

1427
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:36,720
I fear that we will enter

1428
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:39,720
two or three decades of very difficult social conditions

1429
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:42,720
with a lot of sadness and grief

1430
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:45,720
for people who will be overwhelmed

1431
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:48,720
by the speed of technological advances

1432
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:51,720
and their inability to add value

1433
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,720
in this mountain of intelligence that is overwhelming us

1434
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,720
and that will require a lot of regulation.

1435
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:00,720
This is why I do not believe in the death of the framework

1436
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,720
and the death of work.

1437
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:06,720
I think that it will take a lot of frameworks

1438
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:09,720
to regulate these flows of intelligence,

1439
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:12,720
manage hybridization,

1440
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:15,720
between biological intelligence and human intelligence.

1441
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:18,720
I am entirely in agreement with you, sir,

1442
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,720
especially on the fact that later

1443
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:24,720
we will always need management frameworks.

1444
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:27,720
But this is already the case.

1445
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:30,720
There are more and more new generations

1446
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:33,720
who are being fooled, in particular by social networks,

1447
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:36,720
by TikTok, etc., by the ease of obtaining

1448
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:39,720
attention by films, things like that.

1449
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:42,720
And the ease with which Wikipedia

1450
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:45,720
has brought a lot of knowledge

1451
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:48,720
at hand in a very accessible way,

1452
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:51,720
it has not helped people

1453
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:54,720
to become intellectual

1454
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:57,720
and to learn things.

1455
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:00,720
Because the closer the information is,

1456
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:03,720
the less curious people are.

1457
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:06,720
I think we are going to face problems

1458
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:09,720
because it is a society that will know

1459
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:12,720
dizzying gaps between people

1460
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:15,720
who will have the decision-making power

1461
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:18,720
in this society and people who,

1462
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:21,720
unfortunately, will be, as you say,

1463
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:24,720
overwhelmed by this information.

1464
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:27,720
Yes, but we must not idealize the past.

1465
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:30,720
If you take the statistics of 1980,

1466
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:33,720
before the individual computer, before the Internet,

1467
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:36,720
before Google, before the AI,

1468
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:39,720
a very large majority of French people

1469
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:42,720
never read books.

1470
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:45,720
So the lack of curiosity is not born with the Internet

1471
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:48,720
and digital technologies.

1472
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:51,720
There was already a very, very little intellectual curiosity

1473
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:54,720
in the past and we can see it very well

1474
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,720
in the small proportion of people who read,

1475
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:00,720
including before the digital era.

1476
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:03,720
I think the last intervention from the audience

1477
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:06,720
before we close this special,

1478
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:09,720
which is of excellent quality.

1479
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:12,720
Yes, thank you very much. Good evening everyone.

1480
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:15,720
Perhaps a first message to thank Dr. Alexandra

1481
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:18,720
for her brilliant intervention.

1482
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:21,720
We are a little used to these very granular

1483
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:24,720
and very striking interventions.

1484
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:27,720
I am personally in phase with a lot of things

1485
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:30,720
that are moving forward, knowing that I have been for a while.

1486
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:33,720
The question I asked is a bit of a semantic order.

1487
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:36,720
Let's assume that the biological neuron

1488
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:39,720
is really overwhelmed by the cilician neuron

1489
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:42,720
because the speed of information is much faster,

1490
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:45,720
because the evolution of AI is exponential, etc.

1491
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:48,720
In the end, is it possible to have a solution

1492
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:51,720
that is not so much a question of the biological neuron

1493
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:54,720
but of the cilician neuron?

1494
01:27:54,720 --> 01:28:02,720
In the end, will a world dominated by this artificial neuron

1495
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:07,720
be significantly different from another?

1496
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:10,720
Knowing that you said it earlier,

1497
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:13,720
we will see lots of AI,

1498
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:16,720
one AI on the left, one on the right.

1499
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:19,720
You were talking about one in a billion

1500
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:22,720
which would be an extremist AI, etc.

1501
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:25,720
In the end, will this world,

1502
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:28,720
in five or ten centuries, be significantly different

1503
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:31,720
from the one dominated by the biological neuron?

1504
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:33,720
Thank you.

1505
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:35,720
I will answer you.

1506
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:38,720
I will take up what I said earlier.

1507
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,720
On November 29, 2022,

1508
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:44,720
the day before the release of GPT 3.5,

1509
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:47,720
what GPT-4 does in medicine today,

1510
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:51,720
I did not imagine that possible before 2040 or 2050.

1511
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:55,720
My ability to predict is zero.

1512
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:58,720
I wrote a paper in L'Express,

1513
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:01,720
and futurists will say more and more bullshit.

1514
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:04,720
I think it's true.

1515
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:07,720
So, projecting ourselves into the future is extremely difficult.

1516
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:10,720
I think we are not able to predict

1517
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:13,720
the future of society in the era of AI,

1518
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:16,720
the technological unpredictability,

1519
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:19,720
the unpredictability of society's reactions,

1520
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:23,720
social and political reactions,

1521
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:26,720
is absolutely immense.

1522
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:29,720
We cannot exclude that there are massive yellow vests

1523
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:32,720
in some major countries

1524
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:35,720
whose opinion will understand

1525
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:38,720
its overtaking by AI,

1526
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:41,720
and the great difficulty to gallop behind AI.

1527
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:44,720
So I think predictability is very difficult.

1528
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:47,720
I have a hard time imagining scenarios

1529
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:51,720
I imagine the three basic scenarios,

1530
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:54,720
we do not reach the AGI,

1531
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:57,720
we reach the AGI,

1532
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:00,720
or we reach super intelligence,

1533
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:03,720
with declines behind.

1534
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:06,720
But all the political, economic and social interactions behind

1535
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,720
seem extremely difficult to code and synthesize today.

1536
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:12,720
So I think we are not able,

1537
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:15,720
at least I do not feel able,

1538
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:19,720
to predict what will happen in a few decades or a few centuries.

1539
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:22,720
I am afraid,

1540
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:25,720
relatively short term,

1541
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:28,720
that by the end of the decade,

1542
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:31,720
a large part of the population will be afraid.

1543
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:34,720
When you understand that it would be necessary

1544
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:37,720
to make a huge effort to be competitive

1545
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:40,720
with GPT-4,

1546
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:43,720
and that it takes two years of training to be competitive

1547
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:47,720
and that behind it will be GPT-7,

1548
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:50,720
and then Claude V, Claude VI,

1549
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:53,720
and then maybe Mistral 11,

1550
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:56,720
where the IAC modules,

1551
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:59,720
Brivael and Laodice,

1552
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:02,720
will build us,

1553
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:05,720
I am afraid that the opinion is not.

1554
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:08,720
Because today the rate of change in the trade is low.

1555
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:11,720
When you are a technician at the RATP,

1556
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:15,720
you change the maintenance techniques

1557
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:18,720
of the trams or the subways very slowly.

1558
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:21,720
Here we are facing breakdowns in the training needs

1559
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:24,720
which are absolutely considerable.

1560
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:27,720
So I am quite worried.

1561
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:30,720
To tell you the truth,

1562
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:33,720
as a doctor,

1563
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:36,720
I am very worried about my overtaking by IAC.

1564
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:39,720
It is much faster than I imagined.

1565
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:42,720
It is worrying.

1566
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:45,720
At the same time, I am not worried because

1567
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:48,720
even though I am old and I am almost 64 years old,

1568
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:51,720
I am still learning fast,

1569
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:54,720
and until I join the RATP,

1570
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:57,720
I will remain competitive against the IAC.

1571
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,720
In any case, it is plausible.

1572
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:03,720
But there are a lot of people who have less facility to learn,

1573
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:06,720
or less time to learn,

1574
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:09,720
and who will have a hard time.

1575
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:12,720
And who could be afraid.

1576
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:15,720
I think the Yellow Vests will panic.

1577
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:18,720
I have discussed with many Yellow Vests,

1578
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:21,720
in private, on the radio and on TV,

1579
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:24,720
at the time of the crisis of the Yellow Vests.

1580
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:27,720
I have seen their anxiety,

1581
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:30,720
their concerns about the complexity of the world,

1582
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:33,720
the difficulty of the world,

1583
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:36,720
the difficulty of following the evolution of the professions, etc.

1584
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:39,720
I am afraid that the technological cavalcade

1585
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:42,720
that is at work today with the LLM

1586
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:45,720
is leading to new crises for the Yellow Vests.

1587
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:48,720
I think we should anticipate it.

1588
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:51,720
So, this is not a direct answer to your question,

1589
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:54,720
to your remark.

1590
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:57,720
I think we cannot predict the future.

1591
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:00,720
I think we can simply prepare it a little

1592
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:04,720
by detecting the places where there are the biggest political bombs.

1593
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:07,720
And these places are mainly, in my opinion,

1594
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:10,720
education and school,

1595
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:13,720
given the very great limitations

1596
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:16,720
of educational technology

1597
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:19,720
and continuous education technology for adults,

1598
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:22,720
which have never demonstrated their ability

1599
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:25,720
to reduce cognitive inequalities,

1600
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:28,720
which have never demonstrated their ability

1601
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:32,720
to significantly help people

1602
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:35,720
to increase their cognitive level.

1603
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:38,720
There is only one person who told the truth about this,

1604
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,720
but he was very angry about it.

1605
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:44,720
It was Macron before he was elected,

1606
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:47,720
when he spoke about the workers of Gade in Brittany.

1607
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:50,720
He said they have a lot of trouble,

1608
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:53,720
most of them do not know how to read,

1609
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:56,720
they will have trouble to train to change professions.

1610
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:00,720
It was an intrusive reality,

1611
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:03,720
and he was very angry about it.

1612
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:06,720
We dare not say the truth today

1613
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:09,720
about the difficulty people may have

1614
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:12,720
to learn new things, to train for new professions.

1615
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:15,720
In the era of the technological tornado at work today,

1616
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:18,720
we may have to break this taboo

1617
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:21,720
to ask ourselves the real questions

1618
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:24,720
about how we can help people who do not learn quickly,

1619
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:27,720
how we can help people who are not very innovative,

1620
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:30,720
how we can help people who have less intellectual facilities.

1621
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:33,720
These are taboo questions,

1622
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:36,720
and they cannot be taboo questions

1623
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:39,720
a few months after the GPT-5.

1624
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:42,720
We must break the taboo to work seriously

1625
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:45,720
on the development of educational technology

1626
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:48,720
that limits the cognitive limitations

1627
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:51,720
of our most fragile citizens,

1628
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:54,720
who will be in trouble

1629
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:57,720
in the later versions of GPT-4 and its successors.

1630
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:03,720
Thank you for this answer and for this question.

1631
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:06,720
I think we can leave it there.

1632
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:09,720
Thank you very much for coming tonight,

1633
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:12,720
it was very enriching.

1634
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:15,720
Thank you to all those who came to listen,

1635
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:18,720
and thank you to those who intervened,

1636
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:21,720
especially Laurent from MEV Capital,

1637
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:24,720
and then Emy, Thiomar, Réko.

1638
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:27,720
It was a real pleasure.

1639
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:30,720
I hope you enjoyed it too, Laurent.

1640
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:33,720
It was nice.

1641
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:36,720
For my readers, those who read my book

1642
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:39,720
The War of Intelligence at the time of each GPT,

1643
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:42,720
if you have any questions in private message,

1644
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:45,720
you can ask me and I will answer you on points

1645
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:48,720
that you think are debatable.

1646
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:51,720
There were a lot of comments,

1647
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:54,720
I see 36 comments from the space.

1648
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:57,720
If you want to look at what's in there,

1649
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,720
see if you want to answer or not.

1650
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:03,720
I didn't read any, because I thought

1651
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:06,720
it would take too long, but there are small points

1652
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:09,720
that have been addressed that we could even

1653
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:12,720
address in another show if you want.

1654
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:15,720
It takes hours to talk about it,

1655
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:18,720
so it's complicated.

1656
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:21,720
Thank you very much for coming again.

1657
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:24,720
We'll meet tomorrow, for those who want to come tomorrow,

1658
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:27,720
it will be an open mic.

1659
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:30,720
Radio Shad, every night from 10pm.

1660
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,720
We'll leave with a little music,

1661
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:36,720
with Donny Warwick, with Don't Make Me Over.

1662
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:39,720
Thank you very much, Dr. Alexandre.

1663
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:42,720
If possible, in the near future,

1664
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:45,720
you can consider a new approach

1665
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:48,720
to blockchain technology,

1666
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:51,720
but from a purely technological point of view,

1667
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:54,720
on the association of good things,

1668
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:57,720
not just bad things, for the AI of the future.

1669
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:00,720
We think there is a real technological elegance,

1670
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:03,720
a beautiful synergy that is really in front of us,

1671
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:06,720
that we wanted to study with you.

1672
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:09,720
There are many good things to learn

1673
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:12,720
in this technology.

1674
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:15,720
We'll leave it at that.

1675
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:18,720
Thank you, bye.
