\f0\fs24 \cf0 Welcome to Radio Shad, it's Wednesday. It's Wednesday, November 1st, 2023. This is a special show, we're going to talk about everything. We're going to talk about DeFi, we're going to talk about crypto, we're going to talk about Bitcoin, we're also going to talk about the themes that have concerned us on the CTFR recently. What do we do with our community? What do we do with cryptos? How do we become successful? But at the same time, can we do it ethically? And I'm very happy to host this debate, this discussion. I have some interference. In any case, I'm very happy to host this show. Julien Bouteloup, who is already with us and to whom I will give the floor. I've already tried to give you the floor, Julien, but I'll try again. I hope you can hear me well. Good evening, Julien. Good evening, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you on Radio Shad. Thank you, I'm honored to have you here, because I know you're a very sought-after person. I'm very happy to have you here. And of course, hello to everyone who is here. Hi, Quarle. Hi, MagicKing. We have a few bugs on Twitter, I think, because I thought I heard MagicKing, who was a speaker earlier, and now he's not a speaker at all. But I still hear him. I hope it will go well for the rest of the evening, because with Twitter, we don't know. And then there's Laurent from NBV Capital, who joins us right away. Super cool. Laurent, who is normally here about every Wednesday. But I'm very happy that Laurent is here too. How are you doing, by the way? Hi, very well. Thank you very much. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. It's been a busy week. Yes, it's the comeback of the colors on the market. Apparently. That's what I thought I understood. Yeah, it's fine. Thank you again for the invitation. You're welcome. It's super pleasant. So, that's it. Today, we're going to talk a little bit about everything. So, you know what, Julien? I did a... How do you say it? I don't know you. Actually, that's the story. I didn't know who you were. And I saw your interview on the face-to-face that you did. On... What was it again? What was that thing called? On the pencil. You did a face-to-face with the guy from the Russo Institute. And it was a little bit of a heated debate. A little bit... We're not going to lie, a little bit messy. And then... Was it more heated on the debate or more heated on social media? Because I understand that it animated the ecosystem for a few weeks. Yeah, well, the thing was that Nicolas Dufresne was already a little bit on the sidelines due to his positions when he defended, especially Natasha Adjaji, etc. So, there was already a kind of background, you know? A kind of background noise like that. And then, when you did the face-to-face with him, it was like... It's for sure that the video made a lot of talk. And so, actually, I knew you by name. But not more than that. And in fact, what I do very often, I've already been reproached, but... What I do very often is that sometimes, even when I don't know a guest, I don't make the effort to look at what he did on purpose to have the naivest point of view possible to be in place of people who don't know a guest. And that way, it allows me to possibly ask the right questions. And in fact, I couldn't help it. I still looked at a little biography of you just before the show. So, I know a little bit more about who you are. And I was very... I took the opportunity to intervene. Because I didn't stay very long. I just wanted to say hello to Julien. Well, good evening. Because I love him a lot. But I'm very happy that you found out about this guest, Marc, organizer of Fall Soiree, REVCC originally, among the first instigators of many and many crypto projects, whether in the crypto world or in the crypto world. And he has also been the organizer of many projects. A talent engineer with a sporting heart. Julien Bouteloup. You're at a very high bar. And I've been adding a lot of names to the ecosystem since very early on. Very, very early on. I arrived around 2016 in crypto. And I very quickly knew Julien under projects of the time. And then projects until... But even today, until 2024. With several brands. Now that will follow. Steck Capital, Steck DAO type. An excellent Yield Aggregator protocol. Racknews. For anyone who really needs to understand the dangers of hacks. The latest hacks that are coming. The latest hack innovations that are coming on the blockchain. Blackpool. For everything that concerns LNFT. Also, I have always been very impressed. A lot of people followed Julien on everything that was the MEV. Without too many surprises. Our MEV Capital fund. And yeah, it's a pleasure to have Julien here tonight. For the time being. But yeah, it's good that you found out about the brand guest we have tonight. I quickly knew the projects. Not all of them. But it's mostly that I didn't know his background. That is to say, the university course and everything. And in fact, I was super impressed. I didn't know, for example, that you had... Julien, you did something that mixes blockchain and artificial intelligence. At a time when we weren't really talking about artificial intelligence. Like in 2017? Blockchain. Blockchain is a big word. We talk about blockchain. But distributed systems. Distributed systems. Indeed. Torrents. Indeed, as people now call decentralization blockchain. But my course was distributed systems and machine learning. But at the time, it had nothing to do with blockchain. Streaming, distributed systems, everything. So inevitably, it's the basics of blockchain. Okay. That is to say, on a mastodon type model? No, everything we did. Everything that was Torrents. Everything that was Gaza. Everything that was music streaming. Streaming of videos, files, mega-uploads. All these things. And it's true that we deviate a bit. But what did artificial intelligence give you at that time compared to now, for example? Artificial intelligence in 2000... I went to the United States to specialize in artificial intelligence. And we will say that it was the most... I will not say the most, but we will say the most boring and boring that you could. It was often the class that no one wanted to do. And it was really the good geeks in math and programming who got into it. I was in 2015. And I went to the United States to specialize in it in 2018-2019. And at the time, we were only doing mathematical algorithms. We didn't have any macro-level understanding at all to develop tools that were much more user-oriented. Especially like 4GPT or Mid-Journey. What we were doing was just data processing. Not really just, but we were doing mathematical algorithms so that people could try to think or make decisions on their own. And that was math. Now, it's a little sexier. And people of every day can use it quite easily. So inevitably, the feedback and enthusiasm is a little bigger. But you should know that on European territory, and especially in France, artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence is a big word, but machine learning, neural network systems, deep learning, all that really includes a lot of different concepts, which are really all different. It was relatively neglected in the research area in Europe. And we have practically no funding or budget in France. And that's why a lot of researchers in artificial intelligence went to the United States. And you should know that, unfortunately, or for the French history, among the largest researchers in artificial intelligence are French. And a person who won the Turing Award, whose name is Ian LeCun, who went to the United States and works for a big American company. Because at the time, he couldn't have a budget and no one was interested in the subject. And today, 40 years later, it's the field of prediction where all investments are made. Yes, totally. And not only is it happening now, but according to Sam Ackman, in five years, you won't be able to launch. People who are in it now will have too much in advance. So there you go. It's happening now. Yes, that's it. And so you arrived in crypto around 2017 and you launched all kinds of projects. I think I arrived before, no? 2017. No, 2012, sorry. I'm stupid. And you launched a lot of projects. On the other hand, I don't know the date, what was launched, when or what. I know you mostly for Stake Capital. And also Stake DAO, which made a lot of ink flow. Because it didn't work very well. I think it depends on the spectrum. Yes, it depends on where you put yourself. Because for me, Stake DAO is a big success. It's one of the projects that today is among the Big Five and that is still running. In the TVL, the assets in the protocol haven't decreased since Bear Market. So for me, it's always the same. It depends on how you analyze the data and what ecosystem looks at the product. If, for example, you look at the product in relation to its technological performance, then I think it's a big success. If you look at the product in relation to its economic performance, which is the token of governance, then it's another subject. But like many projects in traditional finance, they can take market shares and make incredible economic returns, and yet have a social share or equity that doesn't necessarily trade in the best conditions. But it depends where you go. If you look at it from a speculative investor's point of view, then yes, maybe it's not necessarily ideal. Except that if you joined a few months ago, now you're practically in the 30-40% green zone. But yes, if you look at it in relation to people who joined at the beginning, it's not necessarily a good angle. It depends on how people place themselves. In TVL, how far are you? I didn't keep track. In TVL, we must be in the 70s. I don't necessarily look at TVL, but I think we're in the 60s. We must be in the 70 million. But what's interesting is that we're the leader in incentives on the market. We distribute, I don't want to say nonsense, but between 500,000 and 1 million rewards every two weeks. This makes us one of the biggest protocols in the ecosystem that distributes incentives in the network. And what's interesting is that, to now develop in decentralized finance, it is necessary, not necessarily, but it is preferable to work with Streda because we have accumulated a lot of governance tokens throughout the ecosystem. In particular, we have exceeded the 60 million curve token bar. We are also big on ANGER, big on other different protocols. What positions Streda as an essential tool to be able to try to mount and deploy in the ecosystem. I would like to ask, since I have the opportunity to see you. We have already met. I am Laurent, especially in Portugal. I wanted to know how you were in the crypto in the 2016-2017 years. It was a bit more of a cowboy, 2018-2019, the beginning of the challenge. A beautiful jungle for those who had an engineer and financial side. A lot of inefficiency, a lot of profit. Do you miss this moment? Do you have a little bit of bitterness? Do you have any remorse? Or do you think that now, nowadays, it's different, but it's always nice. It's always exciting. You always find a lot of projects. Or do you think that the good times are over? I really went into the ecosystem by chance. People who say, yes, I was there. I saw the thing coming. That's why I was there. For the majority, it's a bit of a story to sleep on. I got into it because it was my course. I was interested in the distributed system, video games. It just so happened that I was up close looking at the algorithms to do mining on Bitcoin. And then I was in London when Ethereum arrived. I already had a good foot in Bitcoin because I was one of the first faithful, and still very faithful, to Mongox. The bank that had the most Bitcoin in the world. After that, you get a little more interested in the thing because the market was also much higher, relatively high. And with Ethereum, since I was in London, I got interested. It was the first meetups that were there, the first conferences, the events. Indeed, in the groups at the time, we used Eventbrite. I think I was using Meetup, if I remember correctly, for small groups with Bitcoiners. There was no concept of maximalists at the time. It was really people who discussed the potential of technology. Indeed, it was possible. I would say that the majority of people were anarchists, but not maximalists. But for example, let's say the second wave. For example, liquidations on AV1, B2. Do you think we're going to relive that? Are you still in it? Did you manage to industrialize these techniques? Or are they more strategies that we will never get out of the closet? This is the first phase that I explained. It was quite an incredible moment because you asked if the phases were changing. At the time, in the conferences, if you don't remember the conferences, there were four pilgrims, two or three guys. The rest were there and we were discussing the potential. The second wave was really the birth of Ethereum with the potential to be able to do programming on the Internet. Programming of the kind of data. It was really with the smart contracts. There were also small groups on it. There were about 50 or 100. Defcon0, Defcon1, Defcon2, things like that. And then there was really the ICO period. The ICOs were to set up a simple landing page and raise 100 million euros for nothing. That was pretty incredible. And then the period you wanted to come to, the period of DeFi, which really projected the ecosystem into a new scenario. Because you have to know that today it may seem a little disconnected. But at the time, all the people who set up projects in the ecosystem, you could look at them in the ICOs. They were either non-profit projects, which is quite strange, or projects really to solve societal problems. So to develop things in developing countries, make free remittances, things like that. So DeFi really changed the game. Because it was really getting people who were interested in finance, to decentralize finance. And not really these concepts at the time. Of course, you could have money concepts with Bitcoin. But I'm really talking about projects, about people who wanted to set up projects that were really purely decentralized finance. We can say that the majority came with DeFi. And then there was Eldorado. Eldorado, I didn't experience it, but when you read the books, it was the 80s, traditional finance, where everything was possible and non-regulated. And it was a bit of the Far West. And it's true that DeFi was that. I don't think we can see it again. Since the general public, institutions, and the regulatory world are aware of this environment. And so, of course, it's much more complicated today to set up things or innovate without having to account at the legal level, at the regulatory level. And yes, this period has evolved. But there is another period that is being built, which is much more mature, with tools that are much more present, which are mounted, which are usable, and used by a large number. Because when DeFi arrived, or Ethereum arrived, or even when there was Bitcoin, it was relatively complicated to send assets. Today, we say to ourselves, well, I'll take Metamask, or I'll take a wallet with my phone. But at the time, there was really nothing. In the beginning, for example, on Ethereum, you had to run Mist, you had to run your own client, or else you had to open your terminal and make sure to transfer coins. So there was only one, it was either Bitcoin or Ethereum. And so now the tokens concept came later. And that was really the beginning of everything. There were no tools, you couldn't check, you didn't have a data scan, for example, you didn't have all these things. So it's different. And so, inevitably, when you're the first or when you're in it, it's much easier to set up tools like liquidation, like Flash Loads, like Flash Loans. I did my first Flash Loan, I was one of the biggest liquidators, or market makers on Avalanche. That's much easier, because there aren't many actors, you all know each other, we were maybe five. And now, when you institutionalize yourself and when you get bigger, it's a kind of job that's relatively complicated to maintain. So today, I'm not necessarily a big player in the market making business, because there are other priorities. But is the goal to put all this in place to see the new market coming? Indeed, yes. But these are much more complicated things, because you have more actors, you have actors who have a lot of experience in traditional finance, and who bring a lot of baggage. And the goal is to get into an ecosystem that is much harder to penetrate and to take market shares. But it's all more interesting. And to see, for this next wave that may come, if we can draw it, do you think that in a year, a year and a half, we will still be using UxDigilas, to edit its priority fees, or to change its RPC to make a sandwich, whether it's on UxDigilas, or is it like, I don't know, total paradigm, we change, we are on total abstraction, and even for guys who are very precise in their TX, the job changes completely. We are no longer doing what we do now, that is, in a year and a half, it's over, the deal site meetings, the governance meetings, which left, which hidden hand, which thing. Do you think it will go away? Yes, it's going away. Today, everyone says UxDigilas, UiDigilas, UiDigilas, it's a bit our own sphere, and echo chamber. You have to know that now, I don't know, we are still in 2023, in the space of 4 years, 5 years, not even. For me, the UX, the user interface, it has completely changed. Before, we talked about a terminal, a console, where you sent lines of code, and now you talk about having your phone, where you can send money to anyone, where you send assets, where you can sign a transaction, you can also offset transactions, you can do honor and spoof. I mean, it's another world, it's another universe. Yes, indeed, for a Manami Shu, it's not ideal yet, but these phases of evolution, they are incredible. When you look at the macro level, when you look at it, you have the impression that the world didn't have systems or service providers, you didn't have all these people. Today, you have them. You didn't have the players that you have now. I think there are two technologies that are completely revolutionizing, really attacking this angle, which is the UX, it's Secure Enclave and Account Abstraction. These two tools were really missing in the ecosystem. Secure Enclave, which allows you to transform your phone into a public key, a private key, while having the security to use, I don't know, Apple Cloud or something like that to be able to do recovery. And behind Account Abstraction, which allows you to delegate the fact of being able to sign transactions, send with limitation degrees, approval, things like that. And finally, institutions or banks will have to and will be able to use it. These were really the two things that were missing. And the third thing that will really allow regulators to be satisfied or others, if they manage to understand the concepts, is Zero Knowledge Proof. It allows you not to necessarily kill the blockchain by saying, you can't use the addresses because you have to be KYC and ML and so indirectly, your information has to be public. It even goes against the basics of the blockchain. But with Zero Knowledge Proof, you can get to say, or if for example the regulator or someone from the security wants to challenge you to say what was that transaction you made, we think it's a little crazy, prove that it's you and prove that it was to do this or that thing. You can do it by using Zero Knowledge Proof. But here, you don't necessarily give your private information and you prove that this transaction is nothing crazy and that it was to do this or that. And so what will happen is that the products... You assume that the institutions would be OK to use the ZK to finally settle on a public blockchain. I don't say settle. I don't say settle. I don't say they're going to use Zero Knowledge Proof. I say that indirectly, this technology... You have to know that everything we're talking about is a bit like in the 90s when you organized a radio chat and you were talking about HTTP or SMTP. Sorry, I just wanted to zoom out. These people, if you really want to answer the problem of regulators, it's not by saying what you're saying is bullshit, it doesn't work. In fact, it's how we builders will or can create the tools that allow to satisfy or allow to secure the assets of everyone. And I think these three tools, which are Secure Enclave, the ability to find your phone with a wallet, two, Account Abstraction, which allows everyone to be able to delegate certain authorizations on assets and wallets and still have ownership, but not necessarily management. Because, I'm sorry, I don't know the stats, I'm going to be sarcastic, I'm going to extrapolate, but I think that 88% of people in the world don't even remember their Facebook password. So you have to stop saying, yes, it's a private key. These concepts for retail are relatively complicated. And thirdly, Zero Knowledge Proof allows you to be able to determine who is, I mean, to prove that the interaction of a certain activity associated with a wallet is not shady at all. It is also associated with KYC and AML and yet, on the blockchain, completely transparent, it's just a public address. These are tools. This blockchain in question, do you think it could be, in short, Ethereum, which is a public blockchain, or do you think that intellectuals will want to turn their own fucking blockchain into a public blockchain? No. In fact, when you read Mika, or when you read different things in the regulations, it's that they tried to stop the use of crypto for retail. On their part, when you hear them, unfortunately, they failed. So indirectly, a lot of crypto ended up in the hands of everyone. And so, by definition and by transposition, they are now forced to protect their users who are crypto holders. And so, banks, there are banks in Germany, are now forced to be able to provide certain solutions to their users in order to ensure that they are protected. To be able to protect the user, what is it? To guarantee that they are not hacked, that they are stolen. So there is a certain assurance, which means the concept of management of custody. And so, when you hear these different concepts, inevitably, there must be tools. Either the bank becomes a full holder of its assets, and so, inevitably, it doesn't go into the framework of the blockchain at all. It's relatively complicated. Could they enforce the thing? I don't know. But a technology, for now, I think it's relatively complicated. The ability to be able to understand... I'm not going to go into that stuff because people will come up with words that I haven't said. Yes, they think that regulators are not eager to understand these things. No, I think that as we also don't bring these subjects relatively simply so that they can educate... Or that there is not enough education, I don't know. But to say that on their side, I think they don't understand that we have developed the tools to provide this ability to be able to secure the holding of these assets, to be able to use them in a safe way. And there, I think that these three tools... Before, it was impossible. Before, it was normal, I think, that there were relatively advanced questions from regulators, from public authorities, to say, yes, indeed, all these things happen in cryptocurrencies, hacks, etc. How do you guarantee that regulators don't lose their money, don't get hacked, etc. Indeed, it's the message to say, it's the maximalists to say, not you key, not you crypto. But I'm sorry, someone is not going to be at home with his ledger, protected by the burglars, he will say, yes, but I have my ledger at home and so I am protected for life. No, someone comes, he forces you to put the code on your ledger and he steals your crypto. We have to talk about it. And I think that with systems of account abstraction, delegations, and necessarily, the authorities, notably notaries, will arrive with systems that will allow to have a multi-signature, to have a key if, for example, you die, to be able to delegate your signature to someone to be able to use your funds. All these concepts, insurance systems, the banking world. Banks, especially in Switzerland, they come from the traditional banking system, but they start and offer accounts for crypto today. And they are thinking about integrating these different tools. And vis-\'e0-vis, to focus, for example, on the DAO stack, in this very, very near future, because in fact, this trinome, these three parts that you cite, the applications now, like Uniswap, Curve, Coswap, DAO stack, you name it. These applications, do you think we will have a kind of permission of access to certain pools and there you have to be KYC upstream? Do you think it will rather be like that or will it always be very open? And as you say, it will be the ZK that will solve this problem. I'm more in this direction. I'm more on the side that 99.999% of kitchen knives are used to cut meat. And unfortunately, there are an infinite number of people in the world who use it for much more dangerous and criminal purposes. But that doesn't mean you have to stop all kitchen knives. What I mean by that is a bit analogical, which is relatively easy to do, but stop using it and say, all these smart controls will have to use KYC ML liquidity pools. And like that, the people who use them are also KYC ML. So in fact, they are locked in their own room and from there, yes, we are fine because now the room is secured with snipers and we are quiet. No, I really think that you have to stay in an open system, permissionless, but guarantee that the use of these tools is done in a secure way. And so, yes, inevitably, Xenon Edge Proof can say that the activity of an address, we can be sure that it was either KYC or ML, if necessary, not all addresses must be in this case, but for example, imagine, you see that our interaction on the blockchain is relatively dubious, a wallet, well, the authorities can ask in six days to challenge this wallet that can determine the implementation of these funds, where it comes from, where they come from and why. The problem I see with that is that the implementation of ZK on Ethereum L1 will take much longer than what I see today, pools where I now have to be KYC or KYB to provide liquidity and have my left-hand cards. So I'm afraid that even if I would like it to happen like you, I'm afraid that the lobby or the pressure will force applications very quickly to say, it's good, you release your application on L1, you have to give permission, otherwise you're blacklisted. We see a lot, and me too, I'm also part of some pools like that, so inevitably, what is really pushing, and that's what's funny enough, I think we tend to criticize quite easily on the blunder side, on the ecosystem side, without understanding the macro and microeconomic concepts of why and how things were done that way. What I mean by that is that some things have been done because there are hundreds of years of research, of analysis, for example, and we all thought that with DAOs, decentralized autonomous organizations, we were going to change the behavior of governance. You have to know that governance today, with banking systems, democracy or other things, but it's been through millennia, Greeks, Romans, things like that, who tried to find concepts, little by little. You have to know that today no one mentions DAOs, you realize that yes, it was a bit of banking, and as you said earlier, it was the chaos on the delegates, going to the left, things like that. And so, indeed, what is interesting is that everyone wanted to try to push real estate, everyone wanted to push real world assets, real world assets because it would bring back the trillion dollars of liquidity in the ecosystem of decentralized finance, of the blockchain, and so inevitably it's incredible. You have to know that when you try to bring that back, you also bring things that are tied to it. And what is tied to real world assets? It's the most regulated things possible. It's KYC, AML, CTRF. And so, the real world assets, it's real estate, it's bonds, it's derivative products, it's all the things that make you touch, you just put your finger in it, it's that behind you, you are completely subject to the entirety of everything you can hate the most in traditional finance on the side of these anarchists and maximalists of the crypto. And so, yes, by bringing these things back, for example, with BACT, Finance, with Mountain, Estility, Ondo, things like that, when we bring them back, since these products can't touch, because it has to be KYC, AML... Too late, and I'm afraid it's becoming the norm. And so, in fact, by doing that, we brought back these things. And what's interesting is that the entirety of the players in the blockchain absolutely want to see real world assets. But behind that, they don't necessarily understand the consequences, and the consequences are simple. Indeed, it grows, and now we find ourselves with liquidity pools that are backed by real world assets, but the only way to be able to take or leverage these different activities, it's KYC, AML. And what's interesting is that for players who have the ability to KYC, AML, their interests can be relatively interesting, much more interesting than you can find in DeFi, and above all, relatively, by order of magnitude, one or two, much more low risk than other DeFi products. Because these products are indexes, relatively safe products, and backed by traditional finance things. Actually, you see, what's funny is that these KYC, KYC pools have been around all their lives. But what's funny is that they are very composable with the Ecosystem Curve universe, which allows us to have more curve rewards. So I also find that the marriage of, ok, we just opened the door to the strategy, is still beautiful. I think in my opinion, I'm going to use this to say that I was stupid in centralised finance, but I think we had the concept to say... Hello? Yes, sorry, someone was on... I think in centralised finance, in this ecosystem, we say centralised finance is above traditional finance. We're going to revolutionise everything, we're going to replace everything, we're the best, and we're getting there. I don't think it's going to happen. I sincerely think what's going to happen is that traditional finance is going to be obliged to be able to take new market shares, to be able to reduce their costs, to be able to increase and scale, to use the concepts of decentralised finance. As you just said, you're going to have a marriage that is not necessarily wanted by centralised finance, but a marriage that is being operated with liquidity pools that are a bit hybrid. You have KYC, AMR, with fairly fragmented and fairly isolated liquidity, but which allows you to be composable, to be able to operate on top of it, and then go and get the inflation or the rewards of the protocol. And indeed, that's what's happening. And institutions, in general, with FORGE, they're having fun looking at how to make transactional swap systems relatively quickly. You have to know, for example, it's a concept we put in place that was launched on Curve more than three years ago. You could, for example, swap huge amounts with Synthetix's virtual pool. That is, you could relatively make a $100 million swap, and that practically at zero slippage, with a cost of $12, the cost of paying the gas. On the other hand, you had to wait for about more than eight minutes. In the ten minutes, you minted an NFT that represented your position before the swap was effective. And that in just ten minutes. But imagine making such a transaction between two different parties, for example, Societe Generale and Goldman Sachs, it takes months, multilateral parties, with legal systems, financial systems, who will sign contracts, who will put things up for sale, who will make systems, it takes an eternity. Well, that's what they're doing. They did several. I gave presentations at Societe Generale in 2016. They were already on the subject. These tests, they do it on Ethereum L1 in testnet or they use their own blockchain? No, no, Ethereum. Not necessarily. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, they try to be hyperledger. The problem is that they realize that the technical capacity and the drive of the community of builders to build new things and to implement things that would take decades for them, as much to leverage them as to have fun building them. What they're doing is to be able to make sure that if the network breaks that they're completely isolated and they don't have a problem. But while leveraging this technical capacity to be able to send funds at a lower cost, to be able to send to anywhere, to any entity extremely quickly. They are already leveraging. They are already adopting components of decentralized finance, of the blockchain, of crypto, without becoming a product of decentralized finance. It's exactly the same thing that happened during the Internet revolution. You already had financial institutions. For some people who are in their twenties, they may think that the financial world and the institutional world is a mobile application like Revolut. But at the time, you didn't have the Internet, you didn't have the ability to transfer with your phone or with your computer, it didn't exist. And you had on your desk, but the financial banking system didn't change. They always used the same things, they just improved, they reduced their costs, they improved their transfers, they improved their profits, they improved their margins. And that's exactly what's happening today. They're going to use products of decentralized finance to fix internal problems, especially frauds in the blockchain. If it's more efficient, I hope you're right, that they integrate public blockchains. But after all, it's not because they integrate public blockchains that it's going to... It's going to... It's going to have an instant economic downturn on the blockchain. No, but it legitimizes public blockchains. They gave up, they didn't try to make their own blockchain, they didn't try to ban everything. In the end, they said, I admit, your blockchain security system is clean and we use it. I like that. No, there will never be that. If you look at the evolution, the adoption of technology, institutions... You have to know that in some countries it was forbidden for a company to set up its website in relation to its company. It's forbidden. For example, financial institutions or some companies, they also try to set up their own protocol. And yet, they're all using Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP, and they're not saying, yes, we admit, you were right. Yet, Minitel, we were the first on the market. The others didn't use Minitel and we were the first to create this protocol system. And the Americans are not saying, yes, you were right, it's you. It will be completely incognito. It will just be adopted. And the people today who are fighting, in 20 years, this generation will change. We won't be there saying, yes, you were right. It's a battle, a financial battle, but not a battle of egos. You guys are very punk. I thought that with crypto, we were going to blow up banks, and you're telling me that in the end, it's all about regulation. Not necessarily regulation. That's the concept. You're crypto, you're not in regulation. And if you're in regulation, you're not crypto. And if you say that regulation is good, you're going to be destroyed on Twitter because you said that regulation is something that can be good. Maybe the word is a bit strong, but I'm going to use it anyway. Maybe it's a temporary failure of DeFi or crypto. Not being able to find a functional solution for small holders, let's call them that. So now, DeFi is a bit like at the moment, I mentioned that, I used that expression when I received Octavio last week. At the moment, it's a bit like the retirement home of the Whales. So that's it. You have to look for funds. It doesn't work for small holders because you have to pay the fees, etc. You have to look for institutions and you have to conform to the institutions. No, I don't think it's a false speech. I think it's the speech of the pseudo-maximalists. Honestly, I don't deal with institutional speculators. I set up projects every day or I always support projects that are not necessarily institutional speculators. I set them up all the time. The fact that if we talk about regulation or legal, it means it's a failure of crypto. No, I don't think so. The fact that small holders can't have fun with blockchain. Because L2 or other blockchains allow money transfers relatively low cost and relatively fast. If you have on other blockchains Avalanche, Solana, I don't know. And L2, that's what they're going to solve. I think that today users can use certain blockchains without having to pay a lot of fees. Yes, but go explain how to use Avalanche It's different from what I call layer 3. Layer 3 is the complete abstraction of the stack of technology. Today, we're all laughing and talking about zero knowledge proof, blockchain Solana, my L2 is better, you didn't look, I also have my relayer which is functional. These are layers of technology. I'm convinced that today, if we ask the question, what makes up the stack of technology, there are almost 400% of people who are able to answer the question. And yet today, that's what we're talking about. Look at the stack, layer 2, I'm sure of that. Tomorrow, if you really want a success of the crypto, a success of being able to use these concepts, then it's the total abstraction of this complexity. If you use the internet, Twitter, TikTok, Twitch, or Instagram, without saying that the protocol that allows me to use Instagram is Solana, wait, I'm going to open my wallet. We're in the build phase, but if you really want it to be used by your grandmother, she will open it. I sincerely think that, with Twitter or other applications, you can put your NFT or you can do things. Tomorrow, you will use your Revolut or you will use an application Lambda or Twitter. And behind it, there will be a lot of blockchain and crypto concepts that you will never know about. And that will be the success. The success will actually be when the entirety of people will not even mention these different concepts that you mention today, especially like the different protocols or the different layer 2 or different technologies. Enclave, Contrast Raction, things like that. In 20 years, there will be people who will take classes at school to try to learn these concepts, and it will be super boring. They will be bored with Contrast Raction. Ah, now he's talking to me about ZKVM. That's it, ZKVM. If they did the same thing 20 years ago, today, there are people who take classes from Http, from SMTP, from Protocol, from DevOps, and it pisses them off. In 20 years, it will be the same thing. Maybe Protocol will have changed it. And you think, you say tomorrow, would you be able to give a sort of timing where we would see an abstraction account of this level? That is to say, when I arrive at the distributor to withdraw money, I don't care about the network, it works super well, I don't realize the complexity behind it to get my cash from an ATM. What is it, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years? The longer you extend the bear market, the more you will accelerate adoption. The longer you extend the bear market, the more you will accelerate innovation. It's very counterintuitive, but it's true. No, that's it. The entire phases have always followed the bear market. So today, for the bear market, people are building new super interesting things that will surely see the light of day when the market will resume, or that will allow the market to resume. But the contrast action and the secure enclave is where the zero-knowledge proof tools you have to know that it's from its B this year. The contrast action and the secure enclave were the first demos at the beginning of the year for ICC on your mobile because IOS released their new updates that allow you to support the mathematical encryption of Ethereum, things like that. And behind that, you can turn your phone into a private key, things like that. It's a bit recent. Everyone is trying to build their own thing. It's going to become more and more open source. People are trying to do closed source because they want to be able to develop their products and be able to release products that will be adopted by everyone. And as it goes, it's going to be more and more open source. And when it's open source, it's going to accelerate adoption. And the zero-knowledge proof, it's extremely old. It has nothing to do with the blockchain. What I mean is that this is a relatively old thing, even very old, which has undergone phases of evolution that have accelerated. And here, on the other hand, we enter the phase which is what we call, like all mathematical research, the application phase. The application phase. And so often at the time, open source was a concept, but it was military, and then it was retail. And so here we are in this phase. It means that normally, next year, you're going to have mobile applications or stops, where you're going to see what's going to happen. And that's what's interesting. In any phase, you have the euphoria of people claiming that they're going to do things, but they never do anything. And so, for example, in the world of NFT, you have people who have never touched a video game in their life, and yet they're told that they're going to build the best game in the world. And so in the end, you have a game that you haven't played at all, and you go there because you were paid to play it. What we called the pay-to-earn. And now, you do something like that, nobody cares. Why? Because you have other actors who know the name of the game. It's accompanied by production studios, and that's exactly what's going to happen next year. Next year, you won't be able to pitch to VCs or investors, an idea that's completely crazy. But because it's a blockchain, we're going to invest. What the ecosystem will have to do is focus on the product. And by focusing on the product and what it's trying to solve, you're going to completely abstract the blockchain tools. Today, if you look at the decks, we get, I don't know, how many a day, people say, I'm building a project, I'm building a blockchain. Okay, great. It's like if you tell me today, I'm building a project, and you say, I'm tripping. Okay, we have nothing to do. But what does your product do? And 90% of people don't know. They just respond to a problem that they woke up with one day, that they created themselves, and they tried to find the problem to their own problem, that they created themselves. And when you do that, you're going to find mobile applications and desktop applications that have the total abstraction of technology, and yet they allow you to solve a problem later in your life. Either it's asset transfers, or it's asset management guilds, or it's optimization, or it's the signing of authenticated documents. But you don't need to mention that you use the blockchain earlier. You can have fun doing a fully encrypted docusign without saying that behind it you use your private key and also tokens to pay. Because you use the iPhone security key that comes directly from your wallet in your phone when you use facial recognition. You don't care if behind it you use the Apple security key that allows you to secure your phone without sharing private information from your head to their Apple servers. That's exactly what we're going to do. And I think that next year we're going to get the first results of these different products. You're going to be able to use applications that never mention crypto and blockchain, that are built by guys from the blockchain but that don't mention these concepts at all. Speaking of applications, could you talk a little bit about the next product of Stake DAO? Apparently, you're still in the ecosystem and you could do better than what you're doing now compared to Frax, Convex, Convex and Concentrator. No, but the thing is that when you're here for a while and you're still alive and you've been through different phases, you have to look at what is still building in the ecosystem and what is still solid and still trying to innovate. Indeed, I think that if you really look at the technological products, the team, the people who are involved in the ecosystem, Stake DAO is one of the top 5 of the ecosystem, Ecosystem Ethereum and Curve, which is much more of an ecosystem. And what we provide is the optimization of the portfolio. It's being able to provide guild strategies and to use our incentive capacity in the ecosystem to solve problems for users. And so, inevitably, when you have the ability to hold a relatively sufficient amount in certain ecosystems, it allows you to make decisions and to incentivize certain decisions in one way or another and therefore to be able to position yourself relatively strong in the industry. You have other players who joined the game perhaps a little later or in parallel trying to solve problems that we had, but today are struggling to be able to innovate and develop other tools because they are sleeping on their laurels. Do you have names? Names? When you mention names on public networks or videos, you don't get beat up. Sorry. And I think that in addition to some affiliates... Speaking of which, are you happy with Morphoblue which will raise the bar for some? What is interesting is that building an ecosystem, building products for the purpose of solving problems and having a certain longevity is extremely difficult. It's difficult because in terms of builder, you have a beautiful build, a great thing that is incredible and that really solves problems and that everyone can use. If your token is less than 1%, then you take a hit. Yet you spent 6 months with audits, 1 year to develop your thing and use it and it really solves problems. I think that there is in the French ecosystem or in the European ecosystem a lack of recognition on builders because you have to know that they are people who devote practically all their time to build these products. I don't agree with you. I think we are very happy with our engineers in France. There are a lot of schools. But it's weird because you have a project with Americans or other projects in France and the thing is a shit with a little gold on top. Literally, it does nothing. It's really nothing. And yet, because they trade well. They do marketing, they have a crazy business development power that we don't have in France. No, I said in France. For example, a project that does nothing. Literally nothing. Just a landing page and behind a token governance that does nothing. But potentially that trades relatively well or I don't know will be adored and put on the podium of success while behind it does nothing. It's wind. What I'm talking about is that there are projects that are incredible. You have other products that you look at the technical capacity of development, the guys who are behind the teams. It's incredible. And yet they don't necessarily have this notoriety or are adored by the general public. Yes, but that's not the problem with their engineering. It's because in France we are not good at marketing. You have to have Asian or American in the bidi, I think. Maybe. I'm trying to put something in place that could try to answer these questions. The problem is that we are focused on the Cartesian spirit. I don't think we want to push things that don't solve problems. Yes, but in crypto we saw that it was not what paid the most for the moment. But after several pump and dump we think that in the long term technology and the product, as you say... We have to look at who has been in the ecosystem for a long time, who fought to push things, who fought to push ideas that were completely decried or completely... When I said, it was in 2017, I don't remember, I said that governance has much more power than tokens or money because that's how it is in traditional finance. And today, it's the wars of governance, it's the wars of curve wars, it's all that. But we really have to look at who has been there for a long time to build things, who fought, who went through different phases and to be able to back them. I think it's really by pushing this ecosystem, especially the French ecosystem, that you can know that in a good part, I would say more than half, the biggest projects are always French on the board, always French in the funding team or always French in the technical team or technical elite. So we really have this ability, this striking power, we really have to try to leverage it rather than try to criticize on concepts, criticize things that are... I have the impression that there is really a lot of chaos, toxicity, whereas we should really be able to try to leverage this intellectual ability and strike to take market shares in the international world and push this French or European sovereignty on the macroeconomic level. There are in particular initiatives that I quote Brice, with the collective, which he opened with several people from the ecosystem a few weeks ago, which proposes what you say, this lever of our talents in France to try to give back a little bit of French protocols to the international. I recommend to go and see if some have projects. I don't know if Steck Capital, you also have Y-accelerators, you see what I mean? You help projects via hackathons, or do you take later, you go more in phase No, no, no, we have precise, very precise, we have spent a lot of resources, energy, we also have Logigi, which is Logigarage, we accompany a lot of people, we have incubated a lot of projects, we have built an academy, a kind of school, Steckdawa Academy, we have built podcasts, we do a lot in education, we have financed a lot of initiatives, hackathons, we have really participated. It's sad what you just said, because it means that we are not yet enough. I'm sorry. I see you more as a site, precise, but not Y-accelerator. I didn't know you really took the idea of a few NGOs or co-founders. Yeah, I didn't know either, but that's normal, because I don't know too much, so no surprise. I had some questions about what we were talking about earlier, about the presence of French people on the scene. Did you mention obviously Tokenbreeze with Chicken Bones, etc., but if we take the whole ecosystem, are the French people known for their creativity in the field of decentralized applications, in the things that don't take us on the path of regulation? I don't know if my question is clear. For an investor, in the investment ecosystem, the crypto projects, DeFi, which have French people among their team, especially, I would say, engineers, it's a very good sign, because as I said earlier, among the most beautiful successes of the DeFi ecosystem, you have practically more than 50%, maybe 80%, French people in the team and even always French people in terms of co-founders or among the band. Because I think that it was French education, the Cartesian system, schools, preparatory classes, mathematics schools, engineering schools, a fairly simple understanding. It really corresponds for a French head, DeFi speaks to them. You have to know, for example, that traditional finance, many people don't know, but the work of accounts, that is to say, to be able to set up mathematical algorithms, roughly speaking, to be able to take Elk, Nicole Elk, the options derivatives of the general society in the late 90s. All of these things are relatively complex. The most complex of traditional finance was created by the French. Today, I think it's still a huge opportunity for the French to be able to shine on this ecosystem. How do you explain that with all the livelihood in France, for example, that it is one of the most... Well, it may be an impression, but you have the impression that all the elites are completely picking up. The media, let's not talk about it, as soon as we get out of our... Is it more than elsewhere? More than elsewhere? I don't know. I don't think it's more than elsewhere. I think that behind... I think it's only the politicians who have nothing to do with all these things, or they are not educated at all on the issue, or they have other things to do, or they don't care at all. But it's a good point. I don't think it's unfortunate. I think we are among the most alert on the issue, because when you look at it, there are still politicians who manage to mention these different concepts but still, according to you, we are rotten. I think we are the least rotten. That's the worst. The problem is that it's the problem of the echo chamber that I said earlier. We have the impression on our part that it's an important problem and a thing to put in place quickly compared to other priorities. But that's without knowing the micro and macroeconomic problems and that such a technology to put in place or to have repercussions can take decades. And so, since the politicians went to watch for a maximum of 7 years, in 7 years, it didn't necessarily change their mandate. And so, they have to be re-elected and go on issues that everyone manages to understand to be able to be re-elected and things like that that are out of their scope won't necessarily interest them. But unfortunately, it happens too late. It's a bit like any industrial revolution, like what we've been through after the Supreme Presidency, there was the revolution of the shared economy that happened and they got caught up in it. The ubergization of society, the Airbnb, the BlaBlaCard, the stuff like that, the shared economy, they're learning in their heads that there's this revolution of centralized finance. They always act afterwards because it's not part of their... They act when there's a problem. I wanted to... I realized... The fact that when you said you and Laurent that in fact the French are super strong even already in the traditional world, maybe that's also the problem. We're so strong in the old technologies, the old systems, that the guys don't want to let go. It's a bit like the debate we're going to have with The Big Well next week, journalists versus influencers. Journalists still don't want to accept the role of influencers in the ecosystem. Even if crypto influencers have things to blame for, there's still a fight between the old world and the new world. There's antagonism. I don't know. I don't think that... For me, the problem is that we don't explain. I honestly think that influencers and media are in a position of fighting. Yes, we're going to destroy you, we're the best, you don't understand what we're saying. They're on their side, you're little jokers, you're young, you don't understand anything, you don't know your name, that's all. We fight each other like that. If, for example, we were in a process of saying look, for example, you have all the GAFA, Google, Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, every day, our daily life is ruled by these big actors who are not even European, who are not even French, and not even at the European level. But this technology would allow us to regain sovereignty, would allow us to do that. And no, we focus on, yes, but Bitcoin, no, tomorrow we have to... After a while, we even have to eat Bitcoin. You have to eat Bitcoin, you don't have to go around the corner. But that's the speech. So, in fact, inevitably, what are people talking about? It's completely nonsense. No, Bitcoin won't solve if you have a severe disease. No, it's impossible. It's really, we're getting into completely amazing concepts. While we should rather present this technology, which is a technology, it's a technology, it's not a remedy that we're going to put in place, which will potentially revolutionize and which are revolutionizing the world today and tomorrow, potentially, and which will solve problems. But certainly not a remedy. And the problem is that we have an incomprehension, a lack of understanding of the macro and microeconomic consequences or problems. And we think we know everything. Globalization on governments, we've been through this, but on the other hand, they think they know everything because they know the world of yesterday. And so they know how the world of tomorrow can take place. But we're not trying to explain, really, yes, listen, to try to regain sovereignty, we would have to bring in these different concepts because we could be holders of access to data, we could sell data. GDPR was good, but what you've done is crap because there's encryption, your servers aren't encrypted. It's completely crazy when you look at it from the outside, you feel like it's the National Assembly where they're all treating each other like birds and spitting on each other dressed like clowns and everyone is criticizing each other. We're a bit the same, what you did is completely crap, you didn't think about that. No, they didn't think about that because we're in a dialogue mode and we're completely blocked on our positions, whereas if we try to say, on macroeconomic issues, on microeconomic issues, if we want to bring in purchasing power, if we want to try to solve issues that speak to you, we think we've developed these products that we should start using. We think that the problem is that we don't know how to solve it. I have a little question for you. Before that, the question was asked in the comments and someone said, can we talk? Yes, it's the goal of the show. If you want to ask questions or if you want to say something, something relevant and concise, don't hesitate to ask me for the role of speaker, I'll give it to you without any problem. It's already 1h20 that we're together, so I don't think we're going to do a three-hour show tonight. I don't know how much time you're available Julien. I'm going to continue with the question I wanted to ask you, it was the question of the title. What is the real recipe for success in crypto? According to you, what should we do from now on? Whether we are an investor, whether we are a builder, whether we are a media, you can do it separately or together. What should we do to give ourselves chances and also to give chances to the community? I think the simplest thing is to build. If you have a job in crypto and you build a project or join a project that really has the vocation to solve problems, that's important. And not to go pump and dump a token because it's cool. Really focus on knowledge, focus on creating value, on solving problems. And there, normally, success is the key. It's the key to success. Because if you look at all the different phases of paradigm change, or the different phases of market change, most of the projects that are now recognized as mastodons of DeFi were built in pain. They were built by trying little things during a bear market, and it didn't work. Today, when you look at big ecosystem projects, I have a lot of stories about these projects. I don't know one that suffered. I don't know one that had to close the door. I don't know one that was at the end of the road. I don't even know if it was a single ecosystem project where I don't know that this project was successful.  Merci pour cette r\'e9ponse. Merci Superman pour la question. C'\'e9tait cool. Julia, je pense qu'on peut... Conclure la. Il y a quelqu'un qui a demand\'e9 le r\'f4le de speaker. On va pas non plus trop \'e9tirer. C'\'e9tait excellent. Je te remercie \'e9norm\'e9ment d'\'eatre venue. Merci pour cette heure et demie avec nous. And Laurent, thank you very much for having me on this show. It was a great show. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. And honestly, great. I see a little bit of the ecosystem, in the atmosphere of Rake News and everything. So it's interesting to see a little radio like that. And very good work. And thank you all for being there. And I hope that since you didn't know me before, that you were able to discover a little bit of what I do and see a little bit of the ecosystem. Yeah, totally. I'm very pleased. Not surprised, but I found it very good. So I'm very happy to be here. I'm starting to get a little tired after an hour and a half, because I was fully focused on what you were saying. It was a great show. And I leave with my eyes wide open. And in any case, you come back when you want. Live the show and live the difference. Yeah, I agree. Even if it's a landmark of the Wales Retirement Home. The Wales Retirement Home. Anyway, thank you all for coming. New products are coming. It's going to be interesting. There are a lot of new projects coming up. Be careful. I saw everyone trying hard. Here at MV Capital, they need people, they need soldiers to put their tools to the test. So that's it. And tomorrow, for those who are interested, we're doing a show with Vincent, who is also an excellent person. And we do, like every Thursday, a show a little bit out of crypto. So more on fundamentals, geopolitics, geoeconomy. And it's always a treat. So if you're interested in these topics, come tomorrow at 10 p.m. It's going to be super cool. So be there. I don't know. I didn't propose. But maybe one day. I tried, I tried my luck with Nostasia. It almost worked. I tried, I tried. I was very, very tired. So you could do it too. Be very tired. And we'll see how it goes. Okay. Well, I'll ask him. I'll see. It would be cool. And see you next week, David Guel. Good evening to everyone. Good evening to you. And good evening to everyone. And good evening to Laurent. And see you next time. Bye. Thank you very much. Bye, guys. See you next time. Bye.}
