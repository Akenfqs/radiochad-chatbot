Before starting this episode, I invite you all to go to RadioShad.com You will have everything on the show, you will have the link for Spotify and the link for Patreon So it allows me to help me make these shows. Here, have a good listen! Welcome to RadioShad, it's Tuesday, Tuesday, January 23, 2024 And we started this show with a music by Affects Twin My music equipment broke down just before the show So I thought I'd do this, I'll put Affects Twin in the intro Welcome everyone, there are a lot of you, there's a big crowd of Ultra fans It's super cool, and tonight it's a special gaming-blockchain show With a focus on Ultra, and that's why I invited David to discuss the project And also talk a little bit about gaming-blockchain. How are you, David? I'm good, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you very well Great How do you find my title? I always say that every time I come to your place, I always pick up a few slaps So it starts well with the title I wanted to be fair at the same time, I think Ultra is a bit... Here we see what's happening on the market globally And in this kind of environment, it's always the end of the world It's not the first time it happens, it's not the last time But it's true that in this kind of environment where everyone is moral, etc. We tend to be doom and gloom But it's not the first time, it's not the last time We keep working on our goals, we know what we're doing We know everything that's happening, maybe not publicly, but it's happening Our team is motivated and continues to look at our goals And to achieve what we plan on a month-by-month basis Before talking about Ultra, you talked about being moral Do you think that... Because everyone is into the space here, everyone is into crypto It's not always the case, sometimes people aren't into crypto But I think that tonight, yes What do you think about the market right now? Do you think we're going back to the bear market or is it just a weird transition? Do you think we're going to a bull or a bear? The question to a million I can't hear you at all, I don't know if it's me You can't hear me at all? Ah, I can hear you What I was saying is that what I noticed with the bear markets Sorry, the Bitcoin halvening It's that it's never been what was planned It's always been a surprise, there's always been things that were not planned But it's really hard to know what's going on around these periods Because it's really the big players who set the pace of the rest of the market And then the big players look at what's being said When everyone is gloomy, that's when they wait a bit and position themselves And then everything changes Halvenings, we tend to buy them early And then after the halvenings, etc. So you have to look at the overall feeling and do the opposite That's my experience since the birth of Bitcoin Around the halvenings, the big players look at that They have tools that are hyper deep in all social networks And that establish the general atmosphere And then it's based on that that they make their moves We are much more inclined to react to our emotions than they are They look at the data, they let the situation simmer a little And then when it stabilizes for a while, they make their move That's what I saw with all the halvenings So here, in my opinion, it will be the same, there is no reason for it to change I think one thing that needs to be understood is that The crypto market is correlated with the global market Here we see that a lot of things are not going well The global economy in China was a driver for the economy in the West Here everything is crashing, they have a lot of problems Which fall like dominoes Which means that behind us, production is slowing down There is also this in the background There is an event here that I think will happen I think Trump will be elected There is a very good chance that Trump will be elected And if Trump is elected, I assure you that the moment it is announced A little before when he starts to see the numbers Ok, is it going to be Trump? Yes, no, yes, no And I think he will be elected And when that happens, the markets will go directly to the other side And that's guaranteed Because he's a guy who's really into the market Pro-capitalism The markets are waiting for that, all the traders are waiting for that And I think that given the numbers we've seen It's almost guaranteed that Trump will win So it's good for the crypto world And that will happen around the halvening So it's going to be two in one In my opinion, we're going to have a turnaround in all cases Unless it happens before that time So will we have an AAA game on Ultra before the Trump election? So the AAA game in closed beta, I think I think, yeah I'm going to set the record straight There are a lot of people who have asked questions on Telegram There was a big discussion on Telegram There were also questions on Twitter, in the comments It's a participatory show, like all the other shows So not right now, but a little later If people who are listening to us right now If you want to ask questions, say things Ask me the role of the speaker, I'll give you the floor And be concise and relevant Because we don't have much time left David has an hour, so we'll try to do this well So my first question is, where is Ultra? It's been more than 5 years since the project was developed Where are you at the moment? OK, so where are we? Basically, all the foundations are finished So we have L1, which is stable, which works We have a Chrome extension, which is also stable, which works We have our client, we have the game distribution There is still a bit of work on that side There is also a facelift that is scheduled To get to the taste of the day Bigger styles, bigger images, something sexier, more modern We have the standard NFT, which really takes incredible shapes For the last 6-8 months, really at full speed With that, in tandem, we have an API for video game developers But also for DApps Which will also have a version 2, which we are working on Which will allow, basically, everything that touches Is it cutting? Am I the only one who can't hear? It's creepy Wait, I have a problem here with my thing, sorry So I was saying, basically, with this API Either you use it for a DApp or a game Or you can also use it to create a NFT marketplace You can make a NFT marketplace with a single API It's super powerful So that's about it For now, you already know how to do tons of things But with the V2, you're going to have a lot of power Creating wallets, creating marketplaces, all of that is going to be super easy Then we have the eSports platform, Ultra Arena Which is a Steam pick-up We're starting to see that tournaments are subscribing more and more quickly We see that more and more different players are using it We also have partnerships that are going to be announced There will be events in physical places There's also a tournament with Bandai Namco on Tekken There's a lot going on It's still lagging a bit I'm going to take advantage of it I don't know where it's coming from I think it's Twitter It's coming from my home I don't know why it's doing that But anyway, I'm going to try to take care of it So we've put all the foundations necessary to grow our ecosystem And now we're focused on meeting the real needs of the market The real needs of partnerships, the real needs of developers We plan, we say they're going to need this, etc. And then they're like, yeah, but I need to have the NFT ID when I use the API Okay, we're going to make this modification It's a modification of the backend, of the documentation, of all that And they have this feature You go to the next one You have someone who tells you, yeah, but for the partnership, we need a login, etc. And now we're in this phase It's a phase of maturation of the platform That allows us, every time we finish one of these works To address more and more people Because we have other people or other partnerships We say, listen, come back to us when you have this and that We sign the contract And so now we're busy doing these things And as we go along, we can onboard them They can start using our tech more and more easily And we're going to start seeing more and more interesting things So our current priority at Ultra is to make sure we can launch exclusive games So what we announced, but also what will be announced in the near future In good conditions And in good conditions, it means two things It means, on the one hand, solving the technical shortcomings that these developers bring us And on the other hand, making sure that we are able to keep the users who come Because it's good to bring users But if they come to the platform and leave a month later It's not interesting to do all the work So here, if you want, before you can really do marketing And spend our dollars We want to make sure that when we spend the marketing budget And we start doing all the marketing actions We want it to be effective Because to do this kind of marketing, it's not going to cost a thousand bucks So when we do things, we want to make sure that we are really efficient And so it will be able to be done through the work we do The facelift and the updates that are to be done for the NFT marketplace All this will help users to stay And will help us launch the games that will come You were talking about money I want to bounce back on that How is the project finances going? How many years can you develop? Every year you ask me the same question And every year I'll give you the same answer We don't discuss all these things in public Ah ok, I see Too bad, I'll try again But I have a lot of questions About the games I lost my question Yes, that's it One of the particularities of Ultra is to offer tokenized games Does this technology work? Are the games tokenized? Can we trade them? Or is it not done yet? Yes, it's been done I think the first game was tokenized last month All the games were tokenized If you bought a game, you have a NFT But the first one that allowed you to resell it was activated last month And that allows you to buy a game Like with Ultra, all the games you buy are NFT You have all the rules of the NFT that are imposed on you These rules are immutable If you are told that this NFT is exchangeable It will be exchangeable forever Same thing for the right to resell it A little cut A big cut Can't you hear me? I can hear you It's really shitty There's something weird here because I usually see people And here I don't see anything I don't know Speaking of people, Ben The J I don't know how to pronounce it I wanted to ask a few questions before letting people speak But eventually, Ben The J How do you say your nickname? Hello Hello, the community Good evening, David The voice is a bit loud because I'm not used to doing this exercise But I'll try I hope everyone can hear me I'm Ben The J Ben The J That's it Good evening everyone I wrote down a few questions Because I invest a lot on Twitter For Ultra I'm a big fan of the project and the brand My first question is this It's a point that was addressed by David last time In the last conference How can the visibility of the platform For the general public I mean in the marketing sense How can we go from a restricted community Twitter, which is on a closed circle To something that could become a snowball effect On potentially other media Like social media Whether it's the public, television, video games Sponsoring systems For example, if you do an ad on a video game There's the Ultra brand that appears Do you have any ideas in that sense? Is the platform ready for that? All that marketing And for 2024 or 2025 How does the company see it? Okay There are more than ideas There's a tab Which is in the phase of completion Which will allow us to do One of the biggest airdrops In the crypto industry We're talking about millions of users It's potentially the biggest airdrop ever made And so this tab is almost finished We're busy discussing the details What are the goodies we're going to drop, etc. I made a hint about that There's one or two in a live stream I made two But we're talking about a big airdrop So that's on the point Then, that's more pure ultra platform But what interests us most Is to grow through exclusive games And that's also going to happen There's a whole aspect Related to the launch of FPS Which will be done through social media There will be mining, grinding, etc. Via Twitter Which will allow for a huge visibility And will allow people to earn resources And things like that Which will be very important in the game We'll discuss that in the coming month We'll explain how it's going to happen Combined, we're talking about millions of users The airdrop, we've already targeted users We're going to do that in Wave But to give you an idea We've already targeted 1 million users For the first wave of this mega airdrop Ultra platform users Or users of the rich On the networks, via the airdrop We don't have 1 million users yet So automatically, we're talking about users I was going to ask you that question David, how are things going? What are the stats? In terms of game downloads, active users, etc. Do you have any figures? I don't have any figures I'm not the one who's dealing with figures But we released an article Which talked about interesting things Games, what people buy In relation to promotions And things like that I don't have the figures in mind How do you count? Are we far from 1 million? Is that a goal you were talking about? We're far from 1 million But we haven't started anything yet Like marketing That's what people forget We don't have a lot of marketing yet If I may Yes, go ahead There's been a lot of noise recently On Twitter I imagine you saw it If we can't talk about entry But the competition What did Portal do? It's with similar mechanisms That people will interact with the FPS For the launch of the ecosystem What's the thing with Portal? It's going to be a similar system If you haven't seen it, you weren't connected Everyone was busy tweeting It's a hard-to-read farming Through the interaction On the different Twitter posts RT To have farming and leveling For the future airdrops From what I understood It was this system Yes, something like that It's in these areas That we'll have the game mechanisms And then we'll reuse this tech For other games It's going to be really cool Because it makes sense In the game's history And in the game's economy It's going to be really interesting As I explained Maybe not here But in another stream We want to do Ultra marketing Through the games Because at this point It's 2 in 1 You have the successful game We create a success story Which is good to acquire other interesting content And as the game is exclusive on the platform It's automatically advertising for Ultra We can reach a wider audience Than the cryptoscene We'll reach gamers Those who are interested For the platform To bounce back on that The Citadel project Which is developed for the Unix technology And the Ultra wallet The question I ask myself is How easy is it to implement the technology Through games that wouldn't be developed By Ultra studios? Is it easy to implement a game On a certain blockchain And make it on the Ultra inventory wallet? Of course That's what the NFT API Will allow you to do Then we're busy Integrating the wallet In a particular way Which will allow us to inject The interfaces in the games So you'll have an interconnection In the game, outside the game In Ultra, outside Ultra Which will be possible with a minimum effort Because the tech below Is identical everywhere It's going to be very interesting People here Have to develop millions of different things For each platform For each blockchain Here you'll integrate it once And you'll be able to use the same tech In your web page, in your mobile app In your game In the white paper We see a lot of PlayStation logo Sony, Microsoft, etc. So it sells something We're wondering how Infiné Could be linked to all this It's already live Our SDK is already cross-platform If you use the SDK Of our platform You'll be able to Not only publish your game on Ultra But on all platforms For example You use Lobby making Authentication of users Quests That kind of things You do it once and it'll work everywhere Which is not the case With other platforms For example, achievements You have to do it manually for each platform Which is a job That few developers do They do it for Steam And then they do it again for PlayStation Or Xbox But generally You need a game to be mega successful Before people Think about doing it everywhere So that's the advantage of our SDK You do the job once And three quarters of the job is done And it'll work everywhere With a few things So that's another thing It's already live It's another thing to think Sony is developing a game With an NFT system Which is likely to be in the long term Is there an inter-operational possibility On Ultra and Sony? Does it exist or not? If my question is not too complicated I think What we do Goes in that direction A studio that develops a PC game Could be on the NFT On the wallet Would Infine, for example, Sony With its own platform Have links Between Ultra And potentially Things at Sony In the long term That's another thing that's possible First of all I want to know Sony doesn't have a virtual platform For virtual objects For exchanges Things happen in the game But we have a tech That allows you to make Completely invisible transactions That can be signed By the developer Through a particular method And everything is done in real time So it's not a mechanism Like You play the game And you keep the NFT And when you want them You ask us and we give them to you It doesn't work like that You could do it But it's additional work That everyone is busy doing And it's not done in the art rules As it should be If you play with the blockchain You're supposed to own your assets With the mechanisms we have Nowadays You're supposed to keep them And ask us when you want them It's a bit crazy For example When you play If you win And you find a particular weapon On the ground If it's a NFT You take it You quit the game Or you get disconnected You open Ultra You look in your wallet And the thing is there Because it was a real transaction That was signed and sent In real time So with a mechanism like that You can apply it To consoles It's super easy Because you don't have to Do all this Connect your wallet Etc To play the game You automatically have the wallet Which is part of the solution We offer Each wallet is generated On the person's computer With his secret keys Encrypted on his computer And as everything is done Purely We would be able to do the same On consoles, on Xbox, Playstation Etc Where you launch your game And you can do real time transactions On the blockchain Sorry Sorry I'm not a dev I don't have the right words I didn't want to impose Thank you for your time And your answers If you want to continue There's no problem I saw in the comments Someone talking about a sports game I didn't follow Is there a sports game? There's a game Which was supposed to be released But they decided To add a new game mode Which is the PVP Before we launch The whole machine And they are busy Finishing this mode Which I think Is a very good thing It's also a game Hyper NFT heavy And it's a game Which uses our tech From A to Z Which will be Very interesting I won't say more And the Olympic games It's good timing It's very heavy I have one last question It's a bit perverse Tomorrow Let's say I want to buy PAL World on Ultra What prevents me from doing it? What makes 90% of the games Available on our competitors And not being released On Ultra While we were A lower commission Why isn't there A permanent game release? That's a question If you want Launching a platform Like Ultra It starts with Launching the pump And what is the pump? It's users It's content Both are linked It's a bit The story of the chicken and the egg The egg and the hen Imagine you have a developer You talk to him And you say We like your game Put it on the platform He will say How many users do you have? And you say We are busy launching it Come back to me when you have users You talk to users And they say What game do you have? They will come back When you have games It's a normal situation In all platforms With content And the way We solve this problem Is with exclusive games We will have High quality games Which will be launched On the platform And with partnerships On which we work There is one in particular A mega partnership On which we work I hope to be able to announce Soon But there are several On which we work Permanently As you go You will have 1, 2, 3 partnerships Each with x amount of games And you launch the pump Like that But again As I explained at the beginning Of this call Basically When you do this kind of partnership Everyone has small needs I need this, I need that Your login You have to use this standard To be compatible with Notetech XYZ And so we have to As it is a new platform Now even if we have the basics Yes we published a game We have this, we have XYZ When you start All these partnerships You have all these needs to cover And each time You have a month of development here A month of development there It takes time But like Any big thing Any platform of this size It goes You have no choice But it's going well The deals are made The contracts are signed And the development is done So that's all that matters At some point Once they are developed It's done You can move on And one day you have another developer He will ask you Here we have The connection point You have the secret key And you can do it And we are in this situation At the moment I have a question About what you just said A little earlier We will let JBM speak How does the acquisition Of the games happen? Do you start the companies? Or do they come to you? Or is it a 50-50 or a 60-40? It's certainly a mix We have a lot of Web 3 studios Who reach out to us Because Some of them Reach out to us Who use the platform And say We will only publish at your place We have a mix It's really case by case But we have people Who are constantly Busy talking to people And signing deals We have a team dedicated to that I'm going to ask you a tough question When you Leave the companies What are the objections? When they refuse What do they not like? There are no objections Except that They need users That's the only objection There is no one Who told us I don't know There must be someone Who said something But compared to all I thought I understood Because it's not The platform I work on There are no objections Everyone likes it And they have a lot of flexibility That they had elsewhere In terms of The way they sell it The new discount system The different prices The geofencing There are a lot of things We are the only ones with Steam To have this feature The only thing We want users And we come back To what we said We are a little bit In the strategy Without pretension It's not to say Because it's the only example I know Amazon When they started They took a lot of time Because There are several things That are happening In terms of market There is a land grab There are all kinds of things And they really Put a lot The priority On the development of their infrastructure And at one point They were the masters of the world No one could follow them And somewhere Without pretension We don't compare to Amazon Or Amazon's future But somewhere It's our strategy We put a lot of infrastructure A lot of parts That give us a seat And a considerable lead On everyone There is a moment When we will have the users Everyone will come And it will be a snowball effect Because we will have an incredible platform To do business In excellent conditions Better conditions Than on Steam And so we think We need users And we work on it And it's not that we can't do it If we didn't start it So we have to understand If you want We could have failed 10 times If we had spent our money And marketing If we want to do things Effectively There are a series of things That we have to put in place To be able to do it Now we are very close Why? Because on one side The platform Begins to be In a state Of getting better and better To be able to do Marketing And retain players But also We have games here That are starting to be ready And big partnerships here That will come with a game influx Of super quality Of world quality And that will allow us To start To run the growth of the platform So here we are really Busy Until now To put things in place To test them To make sure everything works To listen to the developers To fix things We are busy to strengthen Our position And here This year We will start to shoot We have games We have partnerships We have content, tech Everything is starting to be put in place You are putting everything on development How many people Are in the team? Is it always 60? No, I think we are 80 It fluctuates In terms of percentages How are the tasks divided? How many people work on The blockchain part? On the platform? The frontend? I can't tell you Exactly What I know is that The blockchain team is Consistent in terms of The total size of the company But Since The last 6 months We are busy to transition The company from a purely Development company to An operation company So We have More and more people Who are in charge of Operations, onboarding Marketing Business development That kind of thing Ok We have a great Candidate for Relations developer After the war In Israel One of our Relations developer Rami He is in Israel And We have a great candidate Who I hope Will be onboarded Soon You know the guy Without knowing it was him I can't tell you Who he is yet But all the people Who are interested In the video game industry In development Have seen his work In the years That have passed When you say Rami He left Ultra or he died? He left Ultra Ok I didn't know I wouldn't have said that Casually Ok JBM How are you? Hi, can you hear me? Yes Hi David I wanted to talk about two things The first one The sport game There has been a blur For several years We thought it was a triple A And then you said During a live with Kp That it would be playable on the browser Can you tell us more? And the second question Regarding the marketing And the launch Do the conditions of the market Play a role in the marketing? Or not at all? Don't look at that Regarding the games No Because These games will be marketed Without the crypto angle They are made for To be addressed To the mainstream users So the games were made So that we can Adress them So whether the crypto is good or not Or whether the market is good or not The video games are Always in full form We saw it here With one of the last games I don't remember the name It was a kind of Pokemon Pal World Yes, Pal World They broke the records Last week By the way Generally When we are in a recession Or financial crisis It is during these moments That the video games Sell the best No correlation Or the opposite It is even better If we were a web 3 game I would be worried Maybe When there is a bear market I would say to myself It is not the time to launch You have to wait But here it is not our goal You launch two big exclusive games Web 3 Yes, but We don't market them as web 3 If you want Most of the web 3 games It is a thing Where you connect your metamask And you launch your It is another thing For us It is a web 3 game But it is in the background It is all the advantages you will have And the interactions you will be able to do With the game outside of the game That will be possible To be made With web 3 But you don't need to know That it is web 3 All you need to know is That you can do your thing In your mobile app In the game On the web And it is all connected In real time I can sell my assets But to explain to you No What I know If I do it tomorrow I have everybody Who will come and hit me They are busy They are marketing They are making announcements Etc In this type of game Yes It is not I am sure That people understood It will be really cool Thank you But it is not It is not the traditional game Yes we understood Thank you Chad Can I interrupt Yes I just want to mention An anecdote I saw something You were talking about the sport game I saw it yesterday In my feed A guy who is making a Mario Kart In Javascript And he is developing it It will be the voice of the Navigator Yes So the game Maybe in a client The game At the beginning It was not a web game But You can do it in web and client It will exist in both ways But it will start Being a web game For several reasons Discussed internally But you can download it In Ultra You can access it Directly through the browser You can access it In Ultra Without having to install things You can launch it In web mode Or in client mode But it is 100% The same game I will let Benji speak But try to keep it short Because I would like to ask One or two questions And then we will go on I will go to the main part This time, about the aesthetics Of the platform The layout The lifting Which could be rethought About the inventory And what follows Even about the placement Of the different Marketplaces Of the NFT Do we have a few weeks Or months Something that will be designed To improve visibility You talked a lot about the user quest You said it yourself That it had to be Beyond a month And for that, I think A platform that is beyond ergonomics Something that is clean That makes you want For example, I am a collector So that my different Inventories, I can sort them In this or that way Will that happen soon? You put your finger Exactly on Our Our observation Often, when you build a platform There are many things you want to do So that you have the utility So you start with the utility Where you say, ok, people can do it Ok, I can put something up for sale Etc And then you iterate And you improve, you add The filters, maybe even Small folders, organizations A profile picture, for example For example, that too And that's the things We are working on now The utility is there It's not super sexy It's not the best But making it pretty Is the easiest So here Right now They are busy working on An update Of the NFT marketplace To have A better search With filters, filters by collection That kind of thing And that's the first facelift Or rather Ah, another little cut Sorry So the first facelift Is the NFT marketplace The filters by collection All that The second thing That was designed And that they are Working on Is the facelift of Ultra Games So we have a new design Super sexy So it's the same data It's the same Data endpoints That we reuse To refactor The interface And that's The things they are Working on now So The wallet for the Unix organization Is something that will come later And personally What I would like to do And I already discussed it here When the NFT V2 API Will be released That will allow you To do anything With the NFT And open the source code Of our wallet And that will allow Anyone to contribute To the interface To the wallet's features Because here The thing is that we use APIs that are Internal APIs That were based on systems That are complex Simply because The NFT API didn't exist And now that we have that It becomes a piece of cake For anyone to do anything So I think We will do that And we will open All these features to everyone And Work with the community In collaboration So it will be really cool When I hear that It's my mind Aren't you afraid That the technology you developed Will be used by people With budgets Or by existing companies That are much more important And will be used to Show what Ultra is doing So Our standard NFT Is made so that Anyone can do what we do Because we did it By consuming this technology That is available That said All the people That use our standard NFT Will contribute to the success of Ultra And it's In relation to the design we did The way the standard NFT works The way the NFT marketplace works All of that is part of the protocol And the more people Use this standard The more powerful the protocol becomes So I would say Steam, let's go, use the Unix Because if they use the Unix We win, everyone wins It's made for It's really made for It's in our interest It's in the interest of everyone Who has Unix Who has Ultra assets It's a NFT Benji I'm sorry I would like to ask one last question Because we're nearing the end I don't know if David If you have time We can do this in 5 more minutes Ah ok I have a question Because it's a question that came up very often That was asked On Telegram Also in the comments on Twitter There are people Who question the use of the token And someone also mentioned A possible refund Of the tokenomics for 2024 Can you talk about that a little bit? Ok I can tell you the following The tokenomics Of Ultra Go in particular The token itself Ultra Its utility has not yet been Leveraged The main utility Of the token The one that will really Kickstart the ecosystem Is the fact of needing UOS To be able to guarantee Transactions on the network So I'll explain Here there will be Dex that will start to come On Ultra And with The games that will come What will happen is that You will need more and more To guarantee Your transactions Because if you have market makers That make transactions on the dex For arbitration For x, y, z reasons They will need UOS So you will have A more and more high demand For the UOS token With the launch Of the network To the public By not having UOS You reserve A part of the bandwidth Of the blockchain And as for now Because of the NFTs Games are not launched yet There is little need For UOS bandwidth So you don't need UOS But all of this Is busy To be put in place The dex Is busy To be audited Security, all of that And the games There is one that is ready But on which A game mode is added And the second That will launch in closed beta And will launch later And then there is The partnership with all the other Exclusive games That will also play on it So it is part of the network launch As the token Is directly linked to the need For transactions on the blockchain So it is not gas But it is an allocation On the bandwidth Of the global network Its need will only start When people start Using the blockchain It is logical, it is linked So we are not going to reinvent The economic tokens The token exists for that It is mathematical At some point you will need it You are obliged Your business will be on it You want to guarantee transactions To your users, you buy UOS You stake it and you guarantee your token It is a public resource That people share Through UOS So this is for the developers Who will need it Or the users Why would users Need to stake UOS? Imagine you trade On index Or imagine you trade NFTs non-stop If you want to guarantee That your transactions Pass even when The network is saturated You stake a little UOS And you are good I hope that answered Your question I hope that answered The questions Of the people I am sure there are more But basically I will say honestly It is doom and gloom It is not the first time It is not the last time I try not to think about it Because It is to spend Every time The market is down Everyone is whining I understand But it is not motivating When there is a lot Of negativity, I don't look I look at my calendar I look at all my meetings I look at everything I have to do And I keep going We know what we are doing We keep moving forward Things are going well We must not give up We must not demoralize There is good news Things are going well I am back Anyway, to get back on track There is the Ultra army behind There is no more than we are It's cool You have a very beautiful community I already talked about it The last time we met You were really lucky Because the Ultra community Is really impressive It is true It is true But also You know Even if We are late If you look at the course Of what we do And what we deliver It is a crazy job It is just phenomenal We keep going We improve Things are going well Even if it is not At the speed What I was saying Even if it is not at the speed Of what people would like Or what we would like The facts are there We deliver A lot So yes I am as dissatisfied With the delays As everyone But we see things We see things We are moving forward There are a lot of companies That come and go And 6 months or a year later You don't hear them anymore They just disappear We are still there We sign the deals We are still in the events We do live shows We do tournaments We do a lot of events As much as possible And I think people see that If you look at what is happening In other crypto companies There are few that Really deliver What they promised And here for now We are still on track To deliver what we promised And that's what matters To not give up To keep going And I think people see That we are doing that Ok, that's cool Sorry CypherTux But I can't give you the floor Because we are already past the hour Don't worry It only took 2 seconds Just to say that I attended this live And congratulations Congratulations Big Zer You are very involved It's nice to see I'm not The project Ultra I followed it a few years ago But it's nice to hear This kind of speech Because it raises A certain motivation And you have a strength with the community And keep going You don't have to give up Congratulations I'm with you Thank you I'm going to follow you I've been following Ultra for a long time Congratulations Because it's great It's your strength What we want Is everything you Give us All the support The retweets The tweets All that It's what helps us To get known While waiting for the marketing While waiting for the contracts It's true that We are often told That we have a unique community Even people in crypto When we do events They always tell me Your community is crazy Because you are Very passionate And very active It helps us a lot It makes all the difference That's why it motivates us When We discuss About marketing Events, giveaways We try to do our best To Distribute cool things To people To do things To say You are the first But in the meantime Enjoy the tournaments Thank you for the cap My pleasure Thank you all Thank you David For coming tonight I hope you'll come back It's been almost A year since you last came So maybe In a year For another show Maybe a bit longer Because there were a lot of people With a lot of questions And I guess a lot of people Wanted to talk But it was very interesting Thank you again for coming My pleasure We can do something At the end of the FPS We'll do it We'll do the point Next month Yes Yes, exactly I couldn't, I was geeking out Sorry I hope so I wish you all a good evening Tomorrow, there's a show For those who don't know RadioShad It's every night Five nights a week We won't exaggerate Tomorrow, it's a special show It's going to be fun We'll call people And we'll talk about the blockchain Live So if you want to have fun Come tomorrow That's it Thank you again David And thank you all for coming We'll leave with Affects Twin Because my sound console doesn't work anymore But it's not that bad Thank you all Good evening and see you soon Ciao Ciao
